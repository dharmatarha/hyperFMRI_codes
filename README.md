## Code for hyperscanning fMRI data set

The aim of the repo is to share and review code used for analysing a hyperscanning fMRI data set collected in 2017-2018 at DBIC (Dartmouth), DHMC (Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical) and CBS (Harvard). Work in progress, things might be all over the place and anything might break down at any moment :)

### `old_code`
Scripts / functions that have been applied to at least some of the data at some point. Treat it as unreliable, its pieces were always written in a hurry. 

- #### `old_code/matlab`: 
  Matlab scripts and functions. Mostly written and used under R2017a.
- #### `old_code/python`:`
  Python scripts and functions. Mostly written and used under python 3.5.
- #### `old_code/confounds_related`:
  Code specifically used for confound removal. Includes confound data as well, at least some of it.
- #### `old_code/further_random_stuff`:
  Further stuff I found, mostly docs related to behavioral results (questionnaires and questionnaire responses)
- #### `notebooks`:
  For jupyter notebooks.

### `current_code`
Scripts / functions that we deem trustworthy (for now, until proven otherwise...). No subfolders yet.

### `behav`
Behavioral data collected in the fall for CBS-DBIC pairs

- #### `conRatings`:
  Data from 229 subjects (~25/story) who rated their engagement on a sliding scale during the story. Also has 5 min written recalls from each subject and overall ratings of how well the story flowed, how well the storytellers clicked, and how engaged they were overall.
- #### `storyTracking`:
  Spreadsheets for each story with data from an RA coding when objects/locations/characters are mentioned.
