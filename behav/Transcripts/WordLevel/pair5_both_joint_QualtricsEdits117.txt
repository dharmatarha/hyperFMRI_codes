0:00:00.0 S1: So

0:00:00.6 S1: Sally

0:00:01.2 S1: lived

0:00:01.5 S1: with

0:00:01.7 S1: her

0:00:02.3 S1: father

0:00:02.9 S1: and

0:00:03.5 S1: mother

0:00:04.0 S1: in

0:00:04.1 S1: the

0:00:04.3 S1: deep

0:00:04.7 S1: swamps

0:00:05.1 S1: of

0:00:05.8 S1: Louisiana.

0:00:07.6 S1: And

0:00:07.8 S1: every

0:00:08.1 S1: morning

0:00:08.5 S1: she'd

0:00:08.8 S1: wake

0:00:08.9 S1: up,

0:00:09.4 S1: and

0:00:09.8 S1: she'd

0:00:10.5 S1: take

0:00:11.0 S1: their

0:00:11.6 S1: the

0:00:11.8 S1: boat

0:00:12.0 S1: out

0:00:12.3 S1: into

0:00:12.6 S1: the

0:00:12.7 S1: swamps,

0:00:13.1 S1: and

0:00:13.3 S1: see

0:00:13.5 S1: the

0:00:13.7 S1: alligators

0:00:14.6 S1: and

0:00:15.4 S1: see

0:00:15.6 S1: the

0:00:15.8 S1: storks

0:00:16.1 S1: swim

0:00:16.8 S1: or

0:00:17.0 S1: fly,

0:00:18.1 S1: and

0:00:18.3 S1: catch

0:00:19.8 S1: fish,

0:00:20.8 S1: and

0:00:21.2 S1: she

0:00:21.4 S1: just

0:00:21.6 S1: lived

0:00:21.8 S1: a

0:00:21.9 S1: very

0:00:22.8 S1: peaceful,

0:00:23.4 S1: remote

0:00:23.9 S1: life,

0:00:25.2 S1: never

0:00:25.4 S1: interacting

0:00:25.9 S1: much

0:00:26.2 S1: with

0:00:26.9 S1: anyone

0:00:28.1 S1: beyond

0:00:28.4 S1: her

0:00:28.6 S1: house.

0:00:28.9 S2: As

0:00:29.6 S2: she

0:00:30.4 S2: explores

0:00:32.1 S2: those

0:00:32.5 S2: swamps

0:00:33.8 S2: in

0:00:34.4 S2: Louisiana,

0:00:36.1 S2: always

0:00:36.4 S2: by

0:00:36.5 S2: her

0:00:36.7 S2: side

0:00:36.9 S2: there's

0:00:37.2 S2: her

0:00:37.6 S2: little

0:00:37.9 S2: sidekick

0:00:38.8 S2: her

0:00:39.0 S2: little

0:00:39.5 S2: toy

0:00:40.4 S2: alligator,

0:00:42.5 S2: and

0:00:42.7 S2: he

0:00:42.9 S2: is

0:00:43.2 S2: called

0:00:43.8 S2: Croc,

0:00:44.4 S2: although

0:00:45.9 S2: he's

0:00:46.1 S2: a

0:00:46.2 S2: gator

0:00:46.4 S2: it

0:00:46.5 S2: doesn't

0:00:46.8 S2: make

0:00:47.3 S2: sense

0:00:47.5 S2: to

0:00:47.6 S2: call

0:00:47.8 S2: him

0:00:48.0 S2: Croc,

0:00:48.2 S2: but

0:00:48.4 S2: that's

0:00:48.7 S2: just

0:00:48.9 S2: what

0:00:49.1 S2: she

0:00:49.3 S2: called

0:00:49.8 S2: him.

0:00:50.0 S2: And

0:00:50.7 S2: she

0:00:51.3 S2: and

0:00:51.9 S2: her

0:00:52.5 S2: toy

0:00:53.1 S2: gator

0:00:53.9 S2: in

0:00:54.1 S2: the

0:00:54.3 S2: boat

0:00:54.7 S2: all

0:00:54.9 S2: the

0:00:55.0 S2: time,

0:00:55.6 S2: they're

0:00:56.0 S2: having

0:00:56.2 S2: the

0:00:56.4 S2: time

0:00:56.6 S2: of

0:00:56.7 S2: their

0:00:56.9 S2: life.

0:01:00.3 S1: And

0:01:00.4 S1: so

0:01:00.5 S1: one

0:01:00.8 S1: day

0:01:00.9 S1: she

0:01:01.1 S1: takes

0:01:01.3 S1: the

0:01:01.4 S1: boat

0:01:01.6 S1: out

0:01:01.8 S1: with

0:01:02.0 S1: her

0:01:02.2 S1: toy,

0:01:04.3 S1: and

0:01:04.4 S1: she

0:01:04.6 S1: takes

0:01:04.8 S1: it

0:01:05.0 S1: really,

0:01:05.4 S1: really

0:01:05.7 S1: far

0:01:06.0 S1: out

0:01:06.2 S1: into

0:01:06.4 S1: the

0:01:06.5 S1: bayou.

0:01:07.0 S1: And

0:01:07.3 S1: you

0:01:07.6 S1: have

0:01:07.9 S1: to

0:01:08.1 S1: know

0:01:08.5 S1: that

0:01:08.8 S1: this

0:01:09.1 S1: girl,

0:01:09.6 S1: Sally,

0:01:10.2 S1: she

0:01:10.4 S1: never

0:01:10.7 S1: really

0:01:12.2 S1: has

0:01:12.4 S1: interacted

0:01:13.3 S1: with

0:01:13.7 S1: anyone

0:01:14.0 S1: else

0:01:14.2 S1: besides

0:01:14.7 S1: her

0:01:14.8 S1: parents,

0:01:15.5 S1: and

0:01:15.8 S1: maybe

0:01:16.1 S1: the

0:01:16.2 S1: occasional

0:01:16.9 S1: other

0:01:17.3 S1: bayou

0:01:17.8 S1: fisher.

0:01:18.4 S1: She

0:01:18.8 S1: doesn't

0:01:19.5 S1: know

0:01:19.9 S1: what's

0:01:20.5 S1: school

0:01:21.1 S1: like,

0:01:21.5 S1: she

0:01:21.8 S1: doesn't

0:01:22.1 S1: know

0:01:22.3 S1: what

0:01:22.6 S1: going

0:01:22.6 S1: to

0:01:22.8 S1: the

0:01:23.0 S1: grocery

0:01:23.4 S1: store

0:01:23.7 S1: is

0:01:23.8 S1: like,

0:01:24.2 S1: they're

0:01:24.4 S1: pretty

0:01:24.8 S1: self-

0:01:25.7 S1: sufficient

0:01:27.7 S1: eating

0:01:29.0 S1: gator.

0:01:29.9 S2: And

0:01:30.1 S2: she

0:01:30.3 S2: is

0:01:30.5 S2: super

0:01:30.8 S2: far

0:01:31.1 S2: away

0:01:31.3 S2: from

0:01:31.5 S2: home

0:01:31.7 S2: at

0:01:32.1 S2: this

0:01:32.8 S2: point,

0:01:33.6 S2: but

0:01:33.7 S2: she

0:01:33.9 S2: knows

0:01:34.0 S2: it's

0:01:34.2 S2: gonna

0:01:34.4 S2: be

0:01:34.6 S2: fine,

0:01:35.4 S2: she

0:01:35.5 S2: knows

0:01:35.8 S2: the

0:01:36.1 S2: swamp

0:01:36.6 S2: I

0:01:36.8 S2: mean

0:01:37.3 S2: it's

0:01:37.7 S2: her

0:01:38.0 S2: home,

0:01:39.1 S2: and

0:01:39.5 S2: she

0:01:39.7 S2: knows

0:01:39.9 S2: every

0:01:40.2 S2: tree

0:01:40.6 S2: and

0:01:41.2 S2: every

0:01:41.6 S2: river

0:01:41.9 S2: corner,

0:01:44.0 S2: but

0:01:46.0 S2: night

0:01:46.7 S2: comes

0:01:47.0 S2: and

0:01:47.2 S2: it's

0:01:47.3 S2: falling

0:01:47.6 S2: down,

0:01:47.8 S2: it's

0:01:48.1 S2: getting

0:01:48.3 S2: darker,

0:01:49.4 S2: and

0:01:50.1 S2: she's

0:01:50.3 S2: on

0:01:50.5 S2: her

0:01:50.6 S2: way

0:01:50.8 S2: back

0:01:51.5 S2: but

0:01:52.5 S2: for

0:01:52.7 S2: some

0:01:53.0 S2: reason,

0:01:53.3 S2: she's

0:01:53.6 S2: slower

0:01:54.1 S2: than

0:01:54.3 S2: usually...

0:01:55.0 S1: And

0:01:56.3 S1: she's

0:01:58.2 S1: just

0:01:59.8 S1: taking

0:02:01.7 S1: her

0:02:01.9 S1: time

0:02:02.2 S1: getting

0:02:02.5 S1: back,

0:02:03.2 S1: and

0:02:03.7 S1: the

0:02:04.0 S1: stars

0:02:04.3 S1: start

0:02:04.6 S1: to

0:02:04.8 S1: come

0:02:05.1 S1: out,

0:02:05.2 S1: and

0:02:05.4 S1: she

0:02:05.6 S1: just

0:02:05.7 S1: decides

0:02:06.7 S1: to

0:02:06.9 S1: kick

0:02:07.1 S1: back

0:02:07.3 S1: in

0:02:07.5 S1: her

0:02:07.6 S1: boat

0:02:08.8 S1: and

0:02:08.9 S1: just

0:02:09.2 S1: look

0:02:09.4 S1: at

0:02:09.5 S1: the

0:02:09.6 S1: Milky

0:02:10.4 S1: Way,

0:02:10.8 S1: and

0:02:11.4 S1: it's

0:02:12.0 S1: never

0:02:12.4 S1: been

0:02:12.8 S1: so

0:02:13.1 S1: dark,

0:02:13.4 S1: the

0:02:13.8 S1: moon

0:02:14.2 S1: isn't

0:02:14.6 S1: even

0:02:15.0 S1: out,

0:02:15.2 S1: it's

0:02:15.5 S1: just

0:02:15.8 S1: brand

0:02:16.3 S1: new

0:02:16.7 S1: moon,

0:02:17.2 S1: pitch-

0:02:17.7 S1: black

0:02:18.3 S1: perfect

0:02:19.1 S1: beautiful

0:02:19.9 S1: Milky

0:02:20.3 S1: Way.

0:02:21.2 S1: And

0:02:21.4 S1: she

0:02:21.5 S1: just

0:02:21.8 S1: hears,

0:02:22.6 S1: hears

0:02:23.2 S1: a

0:02:23.4 S1: rustle

0:02:24.2 S1: and

0:02:24.4 S1: a

0:02:24.6 S1: motor

0:02:25.5 S1: starting

0:02:25.9 S1: slowly

0:02:26.4 S1: behind

0:02:26.7 S1: her.

0:02:29.0 S2: So

0:02:29.1 S2: the

0:02:29.3 S2: second

0:02:29.6 S2: boat

0:02:30.0 S2: is

0:02:30.2 S2: pulling

0:02:30.7 S2: up

0:02:30.9 S2: next

0:02:31.1 S2: to

0:02:31.3 S2: her

0:02:31.6 S2: under

0:02:31.9 S2: the

0:02:32.4 S2: pitch-

0:02:32.7 S2: black

0:02:33.5 S2: night

0:02:34.4 S2: sky,

0:02:34.8 S2: and

0:02:35.8 S2: in

0:02:35.9 S2: the

0:02:36.1 S2: boat,

0:02:36.4 S2: there's

0:02:36.7 S2: this

0:02:37.0 S2: shady-

0:02:37.4 S2: looking

0:02:38.2 S2: dude

0:02:38.7 S2: he

0:02:39.0 S2: has

0:02:39.3 S2: like

0:02:39.4 S2: a

0:02:39.7 S2: hood

0:02:40.1 S2: that's

0:02:40.5 S2: pulled

0:02:40.8 S2: over

0:02:41.0 S2: his

0:02:41.2 S2: face,

0:02:41.6 S2: you

0:02:41.8 S2: can't

0:02:42.0 S2: really

0:02:42.3 S2: see

0:02:42.5 S2: what's

0:02:42.7 S2: going

0:02:42.9 S2: on.

0:02:43.3 S2: You

0:02:44.0 S2: can't

0:02:45.0 S2: see

0:02:45.7 S2: his

0:02:46.3 S2: eyes,

0:02:47.0 S2: and

0:02:47.2 S2: Sally

0:02:47.5 S2: is

0:02:47.6 S2: getting

0:02:47.9 S2: kind

0:02:48.1 S2: of

0:02:48.3 S2: scared,

0:02:48.9 S2: she

0:02:49.2 S2: doesn't

0:02:49.4 S2: really...

0:02:51.1 S2: She's

0:02:51.6 S2: never

0:02:51.7 S2: really

0:02:52.0 S2: interacted

0:02:52.4 S2: with

0:02:52.5 S2: people

0:02:53.4 S2: and

0:02:54.6 S2: this

0:02:54.8 S2: person's

0:02:55.3 S2: coming

0:02:55.8 S2: straight

0:02:56.1 S2: toward

0:02:57.4 S2: her.

0:03:00.2 S1: And

0:02:59.0 S1: she

0:02:59.7 S1: just

0:03:00.7 S1: sits

0:03:01.4 S1: really

0:03:01.8 S1: still,

0:03:02.2 S1: and

0:03:02.5 S1: pretend

0:03:03.1 S1: that

0:03:03.4 S1: she's

0:03:05.1 S1: asleep,

0:03:06.9 S1: to

0:03:07.5 S1: see

0:03:07.6 S1: if

0:03:07.7 S1: this

0:03:07.9 S1: person

0:03:08.2 S1: will

0:03:08.4 S1: just

0:03:08.6 S1: go

0:03:08.7 S1: away,

0:03:10.1 S1: but

0:03:10.2 S1: the

0:03:10.4 S1: guys

0:03:10.6 S1: just

0:03:10.9 S1: collides

0:03:11.4 S1: his

0:03:11.6 S1: boat

0:03:11.9 S1: with

0:03:12.0 S1: her,

0:03:12.3 S1: and

0:03:12.5 S1: just

0:03:13.3 S1: hops

0:03:13.6 S1: into

0:03:13.9 S1: her

0:03:14.1 S1: boat

0:03:15.5 S1: and

0:03:16.3 S1: she

0:03:16.7 S1: starts

0:03:17.5 S1: freaking

0:03:18.5 S1: out,

0:03:19.0 S1: and

0:03:19.4 S1: springs

0:03:20.2 S1: open

0:03:20.5 S1: her

0:03:20.7 S1: eyes,

0:03:21.9 S1: And

0:03:22.0 S1: this

0:03:22.2 S1: person

0:03:22.7 S1: pulls

0:03:23.0 S1: their

0:03:23.2 S1: hood

0:03:23.4 S1: off

0:03:24.2 S1: and

0:03:24.4 S1: it's

0:03:25.1 S1: actually

0:03:27.1 S1: a

0:03:27.4 S1: grandmother.

0:03:29.4 S2: It's

0:03:30.0 S2: her

0:03:30.4 S2: long-

0:03:31.0 S2: lost

0:03:31.5 S2: grandmother

0:03:33.2 S2: who

0:03:33.6 S2: visits

0:03:34.3 S2: them

0:03:34.7 S2: every

0:03:35.6 S2: two

0:03:35.9 S2: to

0:03:36.0 S2: three

0:03:36.3 S2: years.

0:03:37.4 S2: And

0:03:39.2 S2: this

0:03:39.4 S2: old

0:03:39.6 S2: woman,

0:03:41.1 S2: she

0:03:41.2 S2: just

0:03:41.4 S2: got

0:03:41.7 S2: lost

0:03:42.0 S2: in

0:03:42.2 S2: the

0:03:42.4 S2: swamp

0:03:42.7 S2: because

0:03:43.0 S2: she's

0:03:43.2 S2: not

0:03:43.4 S2: there

0:03:43.7 S2: very

0:03:43.9 S2: often,

0:03:44.5 S2: and

0:03:44.8 S2: she

0:03:45.1 S2: just

0:03:45.5 S2: made

0:03:45.9 S2: a

0:03:46.1 S2: wrong

0:03:46.4 S2: detour

0:03:46.8 S2: at

0:03:47.0 S2: some

0:03:47.3 S2: point.

0:03:48.4 S2: So

0:03:48.6 S2: now

0:03:49.0 S2: it's

0:03:49.3 S2: Sally

0:03:49.6 S2: and

0:03:49.8 S2: the

0:03:50.0 S2: grandmother

0:03:50.5 S2: in

0:03:50.6 S2: the

0:03:50.8 S2: boat,

0:03:51.8 S2: and

0:03:53.1 S2: it's

0:03:53.3 S2: in

0:03:53.5 S2: the

0:03:53.6 S2: middle

0:03:53.8 S2: of

0:03:53.9 S2: the

0:03:54.1 S2: night,

0:03:54.4 S2: in

0:03:54.5 S2: the

0:03:54.6 S2: middle

0:03:54.8 S2: of

0:03:55.0 S2: the

0:03:55.1 S2: swamp,

0:03:56.9 S2: and...

0:04:00.3 S1: Sally

0:03:57.9 S1: only

0:03:58.5 S1: met

0:03:58.9 S1: her

0:03:59.3 S1: grandmother

0:04:00.5 S1: a

0:04:00.7 S1: couple

0:04:01.0 S1: of

0:04:01.1 S1: times,

0:04:02.4 S1: and

0:04:02.7 S1: she's

0:04:03.1 S1: kind

0:04:03.5 S1: of

0:04:03.7 S1: confused,

0:04:04.4 S1: and

0:04:04.7 S1: recognizes

0:04:05.5 S1: the

0:04:05.7 S1: woman,

0:04:06.1 S1: but

0:04:06.2 S1: doesn't

0:04:06.6 S1: really

0:04:06.8 S1: know

0:04:07.0 S1: the

0:04:07.2 S1: significance

0:04:07.7 S1: of

0:04:08.0 S1: why

0:04:08.2 S1: she's

0:04:08.4 S1: there,

0:04:09.6 S1: and

0:04:09.8 S1: the

0:04:09.9 S1: reason

0:04:10.3 S1: that

0:04:10.4 S1: she

0:04:10.6 S1: only

0:04:10.9 S1: visits

0:04:11.3 S1: every

0:04:11.6 S1: few

0:04:11.9 S1: years

0:04:12.2 S1: is

0:04:12.3 S1: it's

0:04:12.4 S1: because

0:04:12.6 S1: she's

0:04:12.9 S1: really

0:04:13.1 S1: not

0:04:13.3 S1: on

0:04:13.5 S1: good

0:04:13.7 S1: terms

0:04:15.3 S1: with

0:04:15.4 S1: her

0:04:15.6 S1: kids,

0:04:16.1 S1: 'cause

0:04:16.3 S1: she

0:04:16.4 S1: thinks

0:04:16.7 S1: that

0:04:16.8 S1: the

0:04:17.0 S1: kids

0:04:17.3 S1: are

0:04:18.6 S1: not

0:04:19.0 S1: giving

0:04:19.6 S1: their

0:04:19.9 S1: daughter

0:04:20.4 S1: the

0:04:20.6 S1: life

0:04:20.8 S1: that

0:04:21.0 S1: she

0:04:21.2 S1: deserves

0:04:21.8 S1: because

0:04:22.1 S1: they

0:04:22.6 S1: were

0:04:23.0 S1: not

0:04:23.2 S1: educating

0:04:23.9 S1: her,

0:04:24.7 S1: they're

0:04:25.0 S1: restricting

0:04:25.5 S1: her

0:04:25.6 S1: to

0:04:25.8 S1: the

0:04:25.9 S1: swamp.

0:04:28.6 S2: So

0:04:28.6 S2: what

0:04:28.8 S2: the

0:04:28.9 S2: grandmother

0:04:29.5 S2: does

0:04:29.8 S2: is

0:04:30.2 S2: she

0:04:30.5 S2: takes

0:04:30.8 S2: Sally

0:04:31.1 S2: into

0:04:31.4 S2: the

0:04:31.5 S2: other

0:04:31.8 S2: boat,

0:04:32.3 S2: turns

0:04:32.8 S2: it

0:04:33.0 S2: around,

0:04:34.6 S2: and

0:04:35.0 S2: bolts.

0:04:35.4 S2: She's

0:04:35.7 S2: trying

0:04:36.5 S2: to

0:04:36.6 S2: leave,

0:04:37.0 S2: she's

0:04:37.0 S2: trying

0:04:37.0 S2: to

0:04:37.3 S2: kidnap

0:04:38.0 S2: little

0:04:38.3 S2: Sally,

0:04:38.8 S2: and

0:04:39.6 S2: she

0:04:40.3 S2: just

0:04:41.3 S2: tries

0:04:42.3 S2: to

0:04:42.3 S2: leave

0:04:42.3 S2: the

0:04:42.4 S2: swamp,

0:04:43.2 S2: go

0:04:43.5 S2: for

0:04:44.0 S2: an

0:04:44.2 S2: actual

0:04:44.7 S2: city,

0:04:45.5 S2: take

0:04:45.7 S2: her

0:04:45.8 S2: to

0:04:46.1 S2: an

0:04:46.2 S2: actual

0:04:46.9 S2: school,

0:04:47.5 S2: teach

0:04:48.0 S2: her

0:04:48.3 S2: English

0:04:49.0 S2: teach

0:04:49.4 S2: her

0:04:49.6 S2: maths,

0:04:50.0 S2: and

0:04:50.2 S2: actually

0:04:50.6 S2: she

0:04:50.7 S2: has

0:04:51.0 S2: kind

0:04:51.1 S2: of

0:04:51.3 S2: an

0:04:51.4 S2: okay

0:04:51.8 S2: plan

0:04:52.1 S2: for

0:04:52.2 S2: the

0:04:52.4 S2: kid,

0:04:52.8 S2: that's

0:04:53.3 S2: what

0:04:53.5 S2: child

0:04:53.8 S2: protective

0:04:54.2 S2: services

0:04:54.7 S2: would

0:04:54.9 S2: do,

0:04:55.1 S2: right?

0:04:57.5 S1: But

0:04:56.6 S1: as

0:04:57.5 S1: she's

0:04:58.9 S1: pulling

0:04:59.3 S1: out

0:04:59.6 S1: she

0:05:00.1 S1: decides

0:05:01.0 S1: that

0:05:01.6 S1: she

0:05:02.1 S1: needs

0:05:02.6 S1: to

0:05:02.9 S1: try

0:05:03.2 S1: and

0:05:03.6 S1: leave

0:05:03.8 S1: some

0:05:04.0 S1: convincing

0:05:04.5 S1: evidence

0:05:06.3 S1: that

0:05:06.4 S1: would

0:05:06.6 S1: make

0:05:07.0 S1: it

0:05:07.0 S1: so

0:05:07.2 S1: that

0:05:07.8 S1: the

0:05:07.9 S1: parents

0:05:08.4 S1: wouldn't

0:05:08.7 S1: come

0:05:08.9 S1: after

0:05:09.7 S1: the

0:05:09.9 S1: daughter,

0:05:11.4 S1: and

0:05:11.6 S1: so

0:05:11.9 S1: she

0:05:12.2 S1: pours

0:05:12.7 S1: gasoline

0:05:13.4 S1: all

0:05:13.6 S1: over

0:05:14.1 S1: the

0:05:14.8 S1: Sally's

0:05:15.8 S1: boat

0:05:16.6 S1: and

0:05:17.1 S1: just

0:05:17.4 S1: lights

0:05:17.7 S1: it

0:05:17.8 S1: on

0:05:18.1 S1: fire.

0:05:20.3 S1: And

0:05:20.8 S1: the

0:05:21.0 S1: entire

0:05:21.5 S1: thing

0:05:21.8 S1: just

0:05:22.2 S1: explodes

0:05:23.0 S1: massively,

0:05:24.9 S1: and

0:05:25.2 S1: shrapnel

0:05:25.7 S1: ends

0:05:26.0 S1: up

0:05:26.2 S1: hitting

0:05:26.6 S1: the

0:05:26.7 S1: grandmother

0:05:27.2 S1: and

0:05:27.5 S1: Sally.

0:05:29.2 S2: And

0:05:29.4 S2: now

0:05:29.4 S2: Sally

0:05:29.4 S2: is

0:05:29.4 S2: super

0:05:29.4 S2: mad

0:05:29.4 S2: at

0:05:29.4 S2: the

0:05:29.4 S2: grandma

0:05:29.4 S2: because,

0:05:29.4 S2: her

0:05:29.4 S2: toy

0:05:29.5 S2: alligator

0:05:29.5 S2: the

0:05:29.5 S2: Croc,

0:05:29.5 S2: was

0:05:29.7 S2: still

0:05:30.5 S2: on

0:05:30.8 S2: the

0:05:30.9 S2: boat,

0:05:33.1 S2: and

0:05:34.8 S2: it's

0:05:36.9 S2: her

0:05:38.2 S2: only

0:05:38.6 S2: friend

0:05:39.1 S2: and

0:05:39.9 S2: it's

0:05:40.1 S2: the

0:05:40.2 S2: only

0:05:40.5 S2: thing

0:05:40.6 S2: that's

0:05:40.8 S2: matters

0:05:41.2 S2: anything

0:05:41.6 S2: to

0:05:41.8 S2: her

0:05:42.3 S2: in

0:05:42.4 S2: this

0:05:42.7 S2: world,

0:05:43.0 S2: and

0:05:43.4 S2: she's

0:05:44.2 S2: starting

0:05:45.4 S2: to

0:05:45.8 S2: act

0:05:46.2 S2: up

0:05:46.4 S2: against

0:05:46.7 S2: her

0:05:46.9 S2: grandmother,

0:05:47.4 S2: and

0:05:47.6 S2: scratching

0:05:48.1 S2: her

0:05:48.3 S2: and

0:05:48.5 S2: bitting

0:05:48.9 S2: her

0:05:49.1 S2: and

0:05:49.4 S2: fighting

0:05:49.8 S2: her,

0:05:50.0 S2: and

0:05:50.8 S2: suddenly

0:05:51.8 S2: she

0:05:51.9 S2: doesn't

0:05:52.2 S2: wanna

0:05:52.4 S2: leave

0:05:53.3 S2: the

0:05:53.6 S2: swamp

0:05:54.1 S2: with

0:05:54.5 S2: like

0:05:54.9 S2: intense

0:05:55.5 S2: and

0:05:55.7 S2: fighting

0:05:56.0 S2: for

0:05:56.2 S2: it.

0:05:56.5 S1: And

0:05:58.1 S1: then

0:05:58.2 S1: 'cause

0:05:58.9 S1: Sally's

0:05:59.6 S1: never

0:06:00.0 S1: known

0:06:00.2 S1: what

0:06:00.2 S1: the

0:06:00.4 S1: outside

0:06:00.9 S1: world

0:06:01.1 S1: is,

0:06:01.3 S1: of

0:06:01.5 S1: course,

0:06:01.7 S1: she's

0:06:01.9 S1: scared

0:06:02.5 S1: to

0:06:02.8 S1: leave

0:06:03.2 S1: the

0:06:03.5 S1: swamp

0:06:04.0 S1: and

0:06:04.3 S1: she

0:06:04.5 S1: doesn't

0:06:04.7 S1: wanna

0:06:05.0 S1: go

0:06:05.1 S1: with

0:06:05.3 S1: the

0:06:05.4 S1: strange

0:06:05.8 S1: woman,

0:06:06.1 S1: that

0:06:06.3 S1: she's

0:06:06.6 S1: met

0:06:06.9 S1: twice

0:06:07.5 S1: in

0:06:07.8 S1: her

0:06:08.1 S1: life,

0:06:09.2 S1: and

0:06:09.4 S1: so

0:06:10.0 S1: the

0:06:10.2 S1: grandmother

0:06:11.6 S1: knocks

0:06:12.0 S1: her

0:06:12.2 S1: out,

0:06:12.6 S1: to

0:06:13.7 S1: just

0:06:13.9 S1: try

0:06:14.0 S1: and

0:06:14.3 S1: get

0:06:14.4 S1: her

0:06:15.5 S1: to

0:06:16.0 S1: stop

0:06:16.4 S1: screaming

0:06:17.2 S1: and

0:06:17.5 S1: stop

0:06:17.9 S1: bitting.

0:06:18.5 S1: Meanwhile,

0:06:19.3 S1: the

0:06:19.5 S1: grandmother

0:06:20.0 S1: is

0:06:20.2 S1: bleeding

0:06:20.5 S1: out

0:06:20.8 S1: and

0:06:20.9 S1: the

0:06:21.2 S1: toy

0:06:21.6 S1: is

0:06:21.9 S1: getting

0:06:22.7 S1: shifted

0:06:23.4 S1: all

0:06:23.6 S1: over,

0:06:24.6 S1: and

0:06:24.9 S1: Sally

0:06:25.2 S1: is

0:06:25.3 S1: just

0:06:25.5 S1: laying

0:06:26.0 S1: there

0:06:26.4 S1: unconscious

0:06:27.1 S1: on

0:06:27.2 S1: the

0:06:27.5 S1: ground

0:06:27.8 S1: of

0:06:27.9 S1: the

0:06:28.1 S1: grandmother's

0:06:28.5 S1: boat.

0:06:32.8 S1: And

0:06:34.7 S1: well,

0:06:34.9 S1: the

0:06:35.1 S1: grandmother

0:06:35.5 S1: tries

0:06:36.2 S1: to

0:06:36.4 S1: get

0:06:36.6 S1: out

0:06:36.8 S1: of

0:06:36.9 S1: the

0:06:37.2 S1: swamp

0:06:37.6 S1: and

0:06:37.9 S1: leave

0:06:38.4 S1: the

0:06:38.6 S1: burning

0:06:39.1 S1: boat

0:06:40.3 S1: behind.

0:06:41.8 S1: The

0:06:42.0 S1: parents

0:06:42.6 S1: realize

0:06:43.3 S1: that

0:06:44.0 S1: something

0:06:44.8 S1: is

0:06:45.2 S1: burning

0:06:45.5 S1: in

0:06:45.7 S1: their

0:06:46.2 S1: swamp

0:06:46.6 S1: and

0:06:47.1 S1: something

0:06:47.4 S1: just

0:06:47.6 S1: blew

0:06:48.2 S1: up.

0:06:48.5 S1: The

0:06:49.0 S1: explosion

0:06:50.0 S1: caused

0:06:50.6 S1: this

0:06:51.0 S1: huge...

0:06:51.4 S1: Like

0:06:51.5 S1: a

0:06:51.7 S1: loud

0:06:52.1 S1: sound.

0:06:53.3 S1: They're

0:06:53.5 S1: trying

0:06:53.7 S1: to

0:06:53.8 S1: figure

0:06:54.0 S1: out

0:06:54.1 S1: what's

0:06:54.3 S1: going

0:06:54.5 S1: on,

0:06:55.0 S1: and

0:06:55.1 S1: they're

0:06:55.4 S1: trying

0:06:55.6 S1: to

0:06:55.7 S1: figure

0:06:55.9 S1: out

0:06:56.3 S1: how

0:06:56.4 S1: to

0:06:56.5 S1: get

0:06:56.8 S1: where

0:06:57.0 S1: this

0:06:57.4 S1: explosion

0:06:58.2 S1: happened.

0:07:00.0 S2: But

0:06:59.2 S2: unfortunately

0:07:00.2 S2: the

0:07:00.6 S2: parents

0:07:01.4 S2: only

0:07:01.8 S2: have

0:07:02.0 S2: one

0:07:02.4 S2: boat.

0:07:03.5 S2: So

0:07:03.8 S2: they

0:07:04.2 S2: see

0:07:04.5 S2: this

0:07:04.8 S2: huge

0:07:05.2 S2: fire

0:07:05.6 S2: out

0:07:05.7 S2: in

0:07:05.8 S2: the

0:07:06.0 S2: swamp,

0:07:06.3 S2: but

0:07:06.4 S2: they

0:07:06.5 S2: have

0:07:06.7 S2: no

0:07:07.0 S2: means

0:07:07.3 S2: of

0:07:07.6 S2: getting

0:07:08.2 S2: there.

0:07:09.1 S2: And

0:07:10.1 S2: the

0:07:10.4 S2: dad

0:07:10.7 S2: just

0:07:10.9 S2: starts

0:07:11.1 S2: running

0:07:11.4 S2: and

0:07:11.5 S2: just

0:07:11.7 S2: starts

0:07:12.1 S2: diving,

0:07:12.5 S2: and

0:07:14.2 S2: trying

0:07:14.8 S2: to

0:07:15.0 S2: make

0:07:15.1 S2: his

0:07:15.3 S2: way

0:07:15.4 S2: through

0:07:15.6 S2: the

0:07:15.8 S2: swamp,

0:07:16.1 S2: but

0:07:16.2 S2: it's

0:07:16.4 S2: just

0:07:16.9 S2: a

0:07:17.4 S2: dragging

0:07:17.4 S2: him

0:07:17.4 S2: down.

0:07:17.6 S2: And

0:07:17.7 S2: he's

0:07:17.9 S2: getting

0:07:18.2 S2: stuck

0:07:18.5 S2: in

0:07:18.6 S2: the

0:07:18.8 S2: mud.

0:07:19.6 S2: And

0:07:19.8 S2: he

0:07:20.0 S2: sees

0:07:20.8 S2: alligators

0:07:22.0 S2: waking

0:07:22.7 S2: up

0:07:23.2 S2: and

0:07:23.7 S2: swimming

0:07:24.1 S2: away

0:07:24.3 S2: from

0:07:24.6 S2: him

0:07:24.7 S2: in

0:07:25.8 S2: fear.

0:07:28.7 S1: And

0:07:28.6 S1: it's

0:07:28.8 S1: a

0:07:28.9 S1: good

0:07:29.1 S1: thing

0:07:29.2 S1: he's

0:07:29.4 S1: scaring

0:07:29.8 S1: away

0:07:29.9 S1: the

0:07:30.1 S1: alligators,

0:07:30.6 S1: but

0:07:30.8 S1: still,

0:07:31.1 S1: he's

0:07:31.3 S1: not

0:07:31.6 S1: making

0:07:32.0 S1: progress

0:07:32.6 S1: in

0:07:33.2 S1: trying

0:07:33.4 S1: to

0:07:33.5 S1: save

0:07:33.8 S1: his

0:07:33.9 S1: daughter.

0:07:36.8 S1: The

0:07:36.9 S1: only

0:07:37.1 S1: thing

0:07:37.3 S1: that's

0:07:37.5 S1: left

0:07:37.8 S1: for

0:07:38.0 S1: him

0:07:38.1 S1: to

0:07:38.3 S1: do

0:07:38.9 S1: is

0:07:39.2 S1: call

0:07:39.7 S1: the

0:07:40.1 S1: one

0:07:40.3 S1: other

0:07:40.6 S1: person

0:07:41.2 S1: that

0:07:41.4 S1: he

0:07:41.6 S1: knows

0:07:42.0 S1: was

0:07:42.2 S1: living

0:07:42.5 S1: in

0:07:42.7 S1: the

0:07:42.9 S1: swamp,

0:07:43.2 S1: this

0:07:43.7 S1: weird

0:07:44.1 S1: fisher

0:07:44.5 S1: guy,

0:07:44.8 S1: for

0:07:45.0 S1: help.

0:07:46.4 S1: Who

0:07:48.4 S1: is...

0:07:49.5 S1: He

0:07:49.6 S1: looks

0:07:49.8 S1: like

0:07:50.2 S1: Bruce

0:07:50.7 S1: Willis.

0:07:51.2 S1: And

0:07:51.4 S1: he's

0:07:51.6 S1: probably

0:07:52.1 S1: him

0:07:52.3 S1: retired

0:07:52.8 S1: in

0:07:53.0 S1: the

0:07:53.2 S1: swamp,

0:07:53.6 S1: but

0:07:53.7 S1: he's

0:07:53.9 S1: not

0:07:54.1 S1: really

0:07:54.5 S1: sure

0:07:54.8 S1: he

0:07:55.0 S1: is,

0:07:55.2 S1: so

0:07:55.3 S1: he

0:07:55.5 S1: calls

0:07:55.8 S1: him

0:07:56.0 S1: and

0:07:56.1 S1: he

0:07:56.3 S1: tells

0:07:56.5 S1: him.

0:08:00.2 S2: He

0:07:59.4 S2: tells

0:07:59.6 S2: him

0:07:59.8 S2: to

0:07:59.9 S2: get

0:08:00.1 S2: in

0:08:00.2 S2: his

0:08:00.4 S2: boat

0:08:00.6 S2: and

0:08:00.8 S2: go

0:08:01.0 S2: see

0:08:02.1 S2: if

0:08:02.1 S2: it's

0:08:02.1 S2: his

0:08:02.3 S2: daughters

0:08:02.7 S2: boat

0:08:02.9 S2: that's

0:08:03.1 S2: is

0:08:03.2 S2: the

0:08:03.3 S2: one

0:08:03.4 S2: that

0:08:03.5 S2: blew

0:08:03.8 S2: up.

0:08:04.9 S2: And

0:08:05.1 S2: so

0:08:05.2 S2: this

0:08:05.5 S2: Bruce

0:08:05.9 S2: Willis

0:08:06.4 S2: dude

0:08:06.7 S2: just

0:08:07.1 S2: gets

0:08:07.4 S2: in

0:08:07.6 S2: his

0:08:07.9 S2: boat

0:08:08.2 S2: and

0:08:08.5 S2: starts

0:08:08.9 S2: slamming

0:08:09.5 S2: out

0:08:10.2 S2: into

0:08:11.0 S2: the

0:08:11.3 S2: swamp.

0:08:11.7 S2: He

0:08:11.9 S2: has

0:08:12.2 S2: one

0:08:12.5 S2: of

0:08:12.7 S2: this

0:08:13.0 S2: ship

0:08:13.4 S2: that

0:08:13.7 S2: has

0:08:14.0 S2: the

0:08:14.3 S2: big

0:08:14.6 S2: fans

0:08:14.8 S2: in

0:08:15.1 S2: the

0:08:15.3 S2: back

0:08:15.6 S2: and

0:08:15.8 S2: it's

0:08:15.8 S2: just

0:08:16.4 S2: flying

0:08:17.4 S2: across

0:08:17.8 S2: the

0:08:17.9 S2: water.

0:08:18.8 S2: And

0:08:19.0 S2: he

0:08:19.2 S2: sees

0:08:19.5 S2: the

0:08:19.6 S2: grandmother's

0:08:20.2 S2: boat,

0:08:20.5 S2: but

0:08:20.8 S2: he's

0:08:21.1 S2: confused

0:08:21.6 S2: because

0:08:22.6 S2: it's

0:08:22.8 S2: heading

0:08:23.1 S2: in

0:08:23.2 S2: the

0:08:23.4 S2: direction

0:08:23.8 S2: of

0:08:23.9 S2: the

0:08:24.1 S2: parents'

0:08:24.5 S2: house.

0:08:24.9 S2: And

0:08:26.2 S2: so

0:08:27.1 S2: he

0:08:28.0 S2: starts

0:08:30.1 S2: chasing

0:08:32.2 S2: the

0:08:32.5 S2: grandmother.

0:08:33.3 S1: And

0:08:33.5 S1: this

0:08:33.8 S1: boat

0:08:34.1 S1: following,

0:08:34.9 S1: chase...

0:08:35.8 S1: Whatever

0:08:36.2 S1: kind

0:08:36.4 S1: of

0:08:36.5 S1: thing

0:08:36.7 S1: is

0:08:36.9 S1: it's

0:08:36.9 S1: going

0:08:37.2 S1: on.

0:08:38.0 S1: It's

0:08:38.4 S1: gonna

0:08:38.6 S1: be

0:08:38.7 S1: over

0:08:39.1 S1: soon

0:08:39.4 S1: because

0:08:39.8 S1: Bruce

0:08:40.3 S1: Willis

0:08:40.9 S1: has

0:08:41.2 S1: the

0:08:41.5 S1: superior

0:08:42.3 S1: speedboat.

0:08:43.0 S1: And

0:08:43.7 S1: he

0:08:44.0 S1: pulls

0:08:44.4 S1: up

0:08:44.6 S1: next

0:08:44.8 S1: to

0:08:44.9 S1: the

0:08:45.1 S1: grandmother,

0:08:45.7 S1: and

0:08:45.8 S1: he's

0:08:46.3 S1: trying

0:08:46.5 S1: to

0:08:46.7 S1: stop

0:08:47.0 S1: her,

0:08:47.2 S1: trying

0:08:48.8 S1: to

0:08:49.2 S1: figure

0:08:49.5 S1: out

0:08:50.2 S1: a

0:08:50.3 S1: way

0:08:50.8 S1: to

0:08:51.0 S1: talk

0:08:51.3 S1: to

0:08:51.4 S1: her.

0:08:52.2 S1: But

0:08:52.3 S1: she's

0:08:52.7 S1: dead

0:08:52.9 S1: set

0:08:53.1 S1: on

0:08:53.4 S1: to

0:08:53.5 S1: getting

0:08:53.7 S1: to

0:08:53.8 S1: the

0:08:54.0 S1: parent

0:08:55.0 S1: house,

0:08:55.6 S1: she's

0:08:56.1 S1: not

0:08:56.5 S1: stopping

0:08:56.9 S1: for

0:08:57.1 S1: him.

0:08:57.4 S2: And

0:08:57.9 S2: she

0:08:58.4 S2: realizes

0:08:59.4 S2: that

0:09:00.0 S2: she's

0:09:00.7 S2: heading

0:09:01.7 S2: straight

0:09:02.6 S2: towards

0:09:02.9 S2: the

0:09:03.0 S2: parents

0:09:03.4 S2: house.

0:09:03.9 S2: And

0:09:05.0 S2: she's

0:09:05.1 S2: panicked

0:09:05.3 S2: because

0:09:05.4 S2: she

0:09:06.6 S2: doesn't

0:09:06.9 S2: know

0:09:07.1 S2: the

0:09:07.3 S2: swamp

0:09:07.5 S2: very

0:09:07.8 S2: well.

0:09:08.0 S2: And

0:09:08.2 S2: she

0:09:08.3 S2: realizes

0:09:08.8 S2: that

0:09:09.0 S2: she

0:09:09.2 S2: actually

0:09:09.5 S2: went

0:09:09.7 S2: steering

0:09:10.1 S2: the

0:09:10.3 S2: opposite

0:09:10.6 S2: way,

0:09:10.8 S2: 'cause

0:09:11.0 S2: she

0:09:11.2 S2: doesn't

0:09:11.5 S2: want

0:09:11.8 S2: them

0:09:11.9 S2: to

0:09:12.1 S2: know

0:09:12.2 S2: that's

0:09:12.4 S2: she's

0:09:12.6 S2: stealing

0:09:13.0 S2: Sally.

0:09:14.0 S2: But,

0:09:14.2 S2: at

0:09:14.3 S2: this

0:09:14.5 S2: point,

0:09:14.9 S2: this

0:09:15.2 S2: Bruce

0:09:15.2 S2: Willis

0:09:15.2 S2: guy

0:09:15.2 S2: is

0:09:15.3 S2: chasing

0:09:16.8 S2: her,

0:09:17.4 S2: so

0:09:17.8 S2: she's

0:09:18.6 S2: trying

0:09:18.9 S2: to

0:09:19.1 S2: steer

0:09:19.1 S2: the

0:09:19.2 S2: boat,

0:09:19.2 S2: but

0:09:19.2 S2: she's

0:09:19.2 S2: bleeding

0:09:19.3 S2: out

0:09:19.3 S2: 'cause

0:09:19.3 S2: of

0:09:19.3 S2: the

0:09:22.2 S2: shrapnel.

0:09:26.2 S2: And

0:09:26.4 S2: then

0:09:26.6 S2: she

0:09:27.1 S2: hits

0:09:27.6 S2: a

0:09:27.8 S2: huge

0:09:28.4 S2: thud.

0:09:28.9 S2: And

0:09:29.4 S2: the

0:09:29.8 S2: guy

0:09:30.2 S2: cries

0:09:30.9 S2: out

0:09:31.3 S2: in

0:09:31.6 S2: pain.

0:09:32.1 S1: He

0:09:32.2 S1: cries

0:09:32.4 S1: out

0:09:32.6 S1: in

0:09:32.8 S1: pain

0:09:33.0 S1: and

0:09:33.2 S1: he

0:09:33.6 S1: has

0:09:33.8 S1: to

0:09:34.1 S1: figure

0:09:34.3 S1: out

0:09:35.5 S1: how

0:09:35.6 S1: to

0:09:35.8 S1: deal

0:09:36.0 S1: with

0:09:36.1 S1: the

0:09:36.3 S1: situation

0:09:36.8 S1: by

0:09:36.9 S1: himself

0:09:37.4 S1: now.

0:09:37.6 S1: So

0:09:37.8 S1: he

0:09:37.9 S1: slows

0:09:38.3 S1: down,

0:09:39.2 S1: and

0:09:39.9 S1: he

0:09:40.0 S1: gives

0:09:40.2 S1: the

0:09:40.4 S1: grandmother

0:09:41.3 S1: a

0:09:41.5 S1: way

0:09:41.8 S1: to

0:09:42.0 S1: escape.

0:09:42.6 S1: So

0:09:42.8 S1: she

0:09:43.3 S1: turns

0:09:43.6 S1: the

0:09:43.7 S1: boat

0:09:43.9 S1: around

0:09:46.1 S1: and

0:09:46.8 S1: tries

0:09:47.0 S1: to

0:09:47.1 S1: go

0:09:47.2 S1: the

0:09:47.4 S1: other

0:09:47.7 S1: direction.

0:09:48.2 S1: But

0:09:48.3 S1: she

0:09:48.6 S1: just...

0:09:49.5 S1: She

0:09:49.9 S1: realizes

0:09:50.8 S1: she

0:09:51.0 S1: won't

0:09:51.2 S1: ever

0:09:51.5 S1: figure

0:09:51.7 S1: out

0:09:51.8 S1: how

0:09:52.0 S1: to

0:09:52.1 S1: get

0:09:52.2 S1: out

0:09:52.3 S1: of

0:09:52.4 S1: the

0:09:52.6 S1: swamp

0:09:53.0 S1: by

0:09:53.2 S1: herself.

0:09:55.8 S1: So

0:09:56.0 S1: what

0:09:56.1 S1: you

0:09:56.3 S1: gonna

0:09:56.5 S1: do?

0:09:58.9 S2: But

0:09:59.0 S2: the

0:09:59.5 S2: son

0:09:59.9 S2: was

0:10:00.2 S2: Sally's

0:10:00.8 S2: dad.

0:10:01.8 S2: And

0:10:02.2 S2: now

0:10:02.5 S2: Sally's

0:10:03.0 S2: dad

0:10:03.4 S2: is

0:10:03.6 S2: just

0:10:04.0 S2: floating

0:10:04.5 S2: in

0:10:04.6 S2: the

0:10:04.8 S2: swamp

0:10:05.2 S2: and

0:10:05.3 S2: the

0:10:05.5 S2: mother

0:10:06.1 S2: is

0:10:06.4 S2: screaming.

0:10:07.2 S2: And

0:10:07.9 S2: Bruce

0:10:08.3 S2: Willis

0:10:08.6 S2: is

0:10:08.8 S2: just

0:10:09.2 S2: hanging

0:10:09.5 S2: on

0:10:09.7 S2: his

0:10:09.8 S2: boat

0:10:10.0 S2: and

0:10:10.4 S2: doesn't

0:10:10.7 S2: know

0:10:10.8 S2: what

0:10:10.9 S2: to

0:10:11.1 S2: do.

0:10:11.3 S2: And

0:10:11.5 S2: the

0:10:11.6 S2: mother,

0:10:12.0 S2: the

0:10:12.1 S2: grandmother

0:10:12.6 S2: is

0:10:12.7 S2: trying

0:10:13.7 S2: to

0:10:13.8 S2: go

0:10:14.0 S2: fast

0:10:14.0 S2: out

0:10:14.2 S2: of

0:10:14.3 S2: the

0:10:14.7 S2: swamp,

0:10:15.3 S2: but

0:10:15.5 S2: it's

0:10:15.6 S2: just

0:10:15.8 S2: totally

0:10:16.4 S2: lost

0:10:16.7 S2: and

0:10:17.1 S2: stuck

0:10:17.4 S2: in

0:10:17.5 S2: this

0:10:17.9 S2: pitch-

0:10:18.8 S2: black

0:10:19.6 S2: night,

0:10:20.0 S2: where

0:10:21.4 S2: the

0:10:21.6 S2: only

0:10:21.7 S2: light

0:10:21.9 S2: is

0:10:22.1 S2: the

0:10:22.5 S2: light

0:10:22.8 S2: from

0:10:23.0 S2: the

0:10:23.2 S2: Milky

0:10:23.5 S2: Way.

0:10:24.4 S2: And

0:10:24.7 S2: she

0:10:25.0 S2: starts

0:10:25.3 S2: racing

0:10:26.0 S2: at

0:10:26.3 S2: full

0:10:26.6 S2: speed

0:10:27.0 S2: in

0:10:27.2 S2: just

0:10:27.5 S2: any

0:10:27.8 S2: unknown

0:10:28.3 S2: direction.

0:10:30.9 S1: So

0:10:29.4 S1: while

0:10:30.4 S1: Sally

0:10:31.4 S1: is

0:10:31.7 S1: on

0:10:31.9 S1: the

0:10:32.0 S1: run

0:10:33.0 S1: and

0:10:33.3 S1: the

0:10:33.3 S1: parents

0:10:33.4 S1: are

0:10:34.5 S1: there,

0:10:35.4 S1: her

0:10:35.9 S1: whole

0:10:36.2 S1: family

0:10:36.6 S1: home

0:10:36.8 S1: is

0:10:37.0 S1: kinda

0:10:37.3 S1: shattered,

0:10:37.7 S1: the

0:10:38.1 S1: grandma's

0:10:39.0 S1: trying

0:10:39.2 S1: to

0:10:39.3 S1: figure

0:10:39.5 S1: out

0:10:39.8 S1: what

0:10:40.0 S1: to

0:10:40.1 S1: do.

0:10:40.4 S1: In

0:10:40.8 S1: the

0:10:41.3 S1: end,

0:10:41.7 S1: everyone

0:10:43.5 S1: comes

0:10:43.8 S1: to

0:10:44.0 S1: the

0:10:44.3 S1: realization

0:10:45.0 S1: that

0:10:45.2 S1: all

0:10:45.4 S1: they

0:10:45.5 S1: wanted

0:10:45.9 S1: was

0:10:46.1 S1: the

0:10:46.2 S1: best

0:10:46.4 S1: for

0:10:46.6 S1: this

0:10:46.9 S1: kid.

0:10:47.7 S1: And

0:10:48.1 S1: no

0:10:48.2 S1: one

0:10:48.4 S1: ever

0:10:48.7 S1: asked

0:10:48.9 S1: the

0:10:49.1 S1: kid

0:10:50.1 S1: what

0:10:50.4 S1: she

0:10:50.7 S1: wanted,

0:10:51.1 S1: what

0:10:51.4 S1: Sally

0:10:51.7 S1: actually

0:10:52.0 S1: wanted

0:10:52.3 S1: to

0:10:52.4 S1: do

0:10:52.6 S1: with

0:10:52.7 S1: her

0:10:52.9 S1: life

0:10:53.2 S1: and

0:10:53.4 S1: if

0:10:53.6 S1: she

0:10:53.7 S1: was

0:10:53.9 S1: happy

0:10:54.2 S1: with

0:10:54.4 S1: what

0:10:54.5 S1: was

0:10:54.7 S1: going

0:10:54.9 S1: on.

0:10:55.1 S1: Because

0:10:55.5 S1: they're

0:10:56.8 S1: adults,

0:10:57.9 S1: what

0:10:58.7 S1: do

0:10:59.2 S1: they

0:11:00.0 S1: care?

0:11:00.7 S2: And

0:11:00.9 S2: so

0:11:01.6 S2: Sally

0:11:03.0 S2: grabs

0:11:04.2 S2: her

0:11:05.5 S2: toy

0:11:05.5 S2: alligator,

0:11:06.2 S2: Poncho,

0:11:07.2 S2: and

0:11:07.4 S2: just

0:11:07.6 S2: decides

0:11:08.3 S2: that

0:11:09.3 S2: what

0:11:09.6 S2: she

0:11:09.8 S2: wants

0:11:10.2 S2: most

0:11:10.4 S2: in

0:11:10.6 S2: life

0:11:11.1 S2: is

0:11:11.4 S2: just

0:11:11.9 S2: to

0:11:12.1 S2: be

0:11:12.4 S2: with

0:11:12.9 S2: him.

0:11:13.3 S2: And

0:11:13.6 S2: to

0:11:13.8 S2: just

0:11:14.5 S2: go

0:11:15.0 S2: and

0:11:15.3 S2: live

0:11:15.7 S2: away

0:11:16.1 S2: from

0:11:16.3 S2: everybody

0:11:17.0 S2: else

0:11:17.3 S2: and

0:11:17.5 S2: not

0:11:17.8 S2: to

0:11:17.9 S2: deal

0:11:18.6 S2: with

0:11:18.8 S2: the

0:11:18.9 S2: stresses

0:11:19.3 S2: of

0:11:19.6 S2: school,

0:11:22.0 S2: or

0:11:22.3 S2: the

0:11:22.5 S2: swamp,

0:11:22.7 S2: or

0:11:22.7 S2: cooking.

0:11:22.9 S2: She

0:11:23.1 S2: just

0:11:23.2 S2: wants

0:11:23.3 S2: to

0:11:23.5 S2: have

0:11:23.7 S2: fun

0:11:24.1 S2: like

0:11:25.0 S2: any

0:11:25.7 S2: normal

0:11:27.0 S2: kid.

0:11:27.7 S1: She's

0:11:28.6 S1: overwhelmed

0:11:29.6 S1: with

0:11:29.8 S1: the

0:11:29.9 S1: situation

0:11:30.5 S1: of

0:11:30.8 S1: just

0:11:31.0 S1: dealing

0:11:31.3 S1: with

0:11:31.4 S1: three

0:11:31.7 S1: people.

0:11:32.6 S1: She's

0:11:33.0 S1: never

0:11:33.3 S1: gonna

0:11:33.6 S1: make

0:11:33.8 S1: it

0:11:34.6 S1: in

0:11:35.0 S1: a

0:11:35.2 S1: world

0:11:35.7 S1: where

0:11:35.9 S1: there

0:11:36.8 S1: are

0:11:37.3 S1: more,

0:11:38.1 S1: so

0:11:38.6 S1: she

0:11:39.3 S1: decides

0:11:40.5 S1: to

0:11:40.7 S1: just

0:11:40.9 S1: go

0:11:41.1 S1: deeper

0:11:41.4 S1: into

0:11:41.7 S1: the

0:11:42.2 S1: swamp,

0:11:42.4 S1: to

0:11:42.6 S1: parts

0:11:42.9 S1: that

0:11:43.1 S1: only

0:11:43.5 S1: she

0:11:43.7 S1: has

0:11:43.9 S1: explored,

0:11:44.3 S1: that

0:11:44.5 S1: her

0:11:44.6 S1: parents

0:11:45.0 S1: never

0:11:45.2 S1: went

0:11:45.4 S1: to,

0:11:45.8 S1: that

0:11:46.3 S1: only

0:11:46.7 S1: she

0:11:47.1 S1: knows.

0:11:47.6 S1: And

0:11:47.8 S1: she

0:11:48.0 S1: knows

0:11:48.2 S1: she's

0:11:48.4 S1: gonna

0:11:48.6 S1: make

0:11:48.7 S1: a

0:11:48.9 S1: life

0:11:49.1 S1: for

0:11:49.7 S1: herself

0:11:50.7 S1: and

0:11:51.1 S1: be

0:11:51.7 S1: self-

0:11:51.9 S1: sufficient,

0:11:52.7 S1: self-

0:11:52.9 S1: sustained.

0:11:53.3 S1: And

0:11:53.5 S1: from

0:11:53.7 S1: there,

0:11:54.0 S1: figure

0:11:54.2 S1: out

0:11:54.5 S1: how

0:11:54.6 S1: to

0:11:54.8 S1: find

0:11:55.0 S1: other

0:11:55.2 S1: kids

0:11:55.5 S1: to

0:11:55.7 S1: play

0:11:55.9 S1: with.

0:11:57.3 S2: So

0:11:57.7 S2: she

0:11:58.3 S2: goes

0:11:59.0 S2: and

0:11:59.6 S2: she

0:12:00.2 S2: sets

0:12:00.9 S2: up

0:12:01.2 S2: her

0:12:01.4 S2: own

0:12:01.8 S2: beautiful,

0:12:02.7 S2: hanging

0:12:03.2 S2: tree

0:12:03.5 S2: house

0:12:03.9 S2: above

0:12:04.1 S2: the

0:12:04.3 S2: swamp.

0:12:05.7 S2: And

0:12:05.9 S2: it

0:12:06.0 S2: might

0:12:06.4 S2: be

0:12:06.6 S2: infested

0:12:07.0 S2: a

0:12:07.1 S2: little

0:12:07.4 S2: bit

0:12:07.6 S2: with

0:12:07.7 S2: mosquitoes,

0:12:08.9 S2: but

0:12:09.1 S2: this

0:12:09.6 S2: thing

0:12:09.6 S2: is

0:12:09.8 S2: just

0:12:10.4 S2: beautiful.

0:12:11.5 S2: And

0:12:11.6 S2: it

0:12:11.8 S2: has

0:12:13.0 S2: a

0:12:13.4 S2: hanging

0:12:15.0 S2: wood,

0:12:15.4 S2: swinging

0:12:16.9 S2: bridge

0:12:17.8 S2: between

0:12:18.4 S2: two

0:12:18.6 S2: compartments.

0:12:20.1 S2: And

0:12:20.4 S2: she

0:12:20.6 S2: has

0:12:20.8 S2: an

0:12:20.9 S2: entire

0:12:21.5 S2: playhouse

0:12:22.2 S2: for

0:12:22.4 S2: her

0:12:22.6 S2: pet

0:12:22.8 S2: alligator

0:12:25.1 S2: toy.

0:12:25.6 S2: And

0:12:26.2 S2: she

0:12:26.3 S2: just

0:12:26.5 S2: built

0:12:26.7 S2: it

0:12:26.8 S2: all

0:12:27.0 S2: herself.

0:12:28.8 S1: And

0:12:29.1 S1: there's

0:12:29.4 S1: this

0:12:29.7 S1: huge

0:12:30.1 S1: hammock

0:12:30.6 S1: that

0:12:30.9 S1: she

0:12:31.1 S1: loves

0:12:31.5 S1: and

0:12:31.7 S1: she

0:12:31.9 S1: cuddles

0:12:32.4 S1: up

0:12:32.6 S1: in

0:12:32.7 S1: at

0:12:33.0 S1: night.

0:12:33.9 S1: And,

0:12:34.2 S1: in

0:12:34.3 S1: the

0:12:34.4 S1: end,

0:12:34.9 S1: this

0:12:35.2 S1: place

0:12:35.4 S1: is

0:12:35.5 S1: basically

0:12:36.1 S1: paradise.

0:12:37.6 S1: And

0:12:37.7 S1: even

0:12:38.0 S1: though

0:12:38.2 S1: she

0:12:38.3 S1: has

0:12:38.5 S1: a

0:12:38.7 S1: list

0:12:38.9 S1: of

0:12:39.3 S1: her

0:12:39.5 S1: toy,

0:12:40.3 S1: she

0:12:40.5 S1: feels

0:12:40.8 S1: kind

0:12:41.1 S1: of

0:12:41.2 S1: lonely.

0:12:42.4 S1: And

0:12:42.9 S1: she

0:12:43.1 S1: realizes

0:12:44.3 S1: that

0:12:44.5 S1: she

0:12:44.9 S1: left

0:12:45.1 S1: her

0:12:45.2 S1: grandmother

0:12:45.8 S1: behind,

0:12:46.4 S1: and

0:12:46.6 S1: that

0:12:46.8 S1: she

0:12:46.9 S1: left

0:12:47.4 S1: her

0:12:47.7 S1: parents

0:12:48.1 S1: behind,

0:12:48.6 S1: and

0:12:49.4 S1: some

0:12:49.5 S1: people

0:12:49.9 S1: probably

0:12:50.5 S1: died

0:12:51.6 S1: during

0:12:51.9 S1: her

0:12:52.0 S1: escape.

0:12:53.7 S1: And

0:12:54.7 S1: she

0:12:55.4 S1: realized

0:12:55.7 S1: that

0:12:55.9 S1: she

0:12:56.0 S1: numbed

0:12:56.3 S1: all

0:12:56.5 S1: of

0:12:56.6 S1: the

0:12:56.8 S1: pain

0:12:57.0 S1: of

0:12:57.1 S1: that

0:12:57.4 S1: by

0:12:57.6 S1: building

0:12:58.0 S1: this

0:12:58.2 S1: paradise.

0:13:00.9 S2: And

0:13:00.4 S2: she

0:13:00.8 S2: feels

0:13:01.4 S2: guilty

0:13:01.9 S2: about

0:13:02.2 S2: it.

0:13:02.5 S2: And

0:13:02.9 S2: she

0:13:03.4 S2: thinks

0:13:04.1 S2: that

0:13:04.4 S2: she'll

0:13:05.1 S2: go

0:13:05.4 S2: back.

0:13:05.9 S2: But

0:13:06.3 S2: it's

0:13:06.8 S2: been

0:13:07.3 S2: two

0:13:07.7 S2: or

0:13:07.8 S2: three

0:13:08.1 S2: years

0:13:08.6 S2: and

0:13:08.9 S2: she's

0:13:09.1 S2: just

0:13:09.3 S2: been

0:13:09.5 S2: living

0:13:09.7 S2: alone.

0:13:10.3 S2: And

0:13:10.3 S2: she

0:13:10.5 S2: doesn't

0:13:10.8 S2: even

0:13:11.0 S2: know

0:13:11.2 S2: if

0:13:11.4 S2: her

0:13:11.6 S2: parents

0:13:12.0 S2: are

0:13:12.2 S2: alive

0:13:12.8 S2: or

0:13:13.1 S2: if

0:13:13.3 S2: her

0:13:13.6 S2: grandmother

0:13:14.9 S2: survived.

0:13:16.1 S2: And

0:13:16.3 S2: if

0:13:16.4 S2: her

0:13:16.5 S2: grandmother

0:13:17.0 S2: did

0:13:17.2 S2: survive,

0:13:17.6 S2: she

0:13:18.0 S2: has

0:13:18.2 S2: to

0:13:18.3 S2: go

0:13:18.7 S2: find

0:13:19.0 S2: that

0:13:19.1 S2: out

0:13:19.3 S2: from

0:13:19.4 S2: her

0:13:19.6 S2: parents

0:13:20.1 S2: and

0:13:20.2 S2: actually

0:13:20.6 S2: interact

0:13:21.0 S2: with

0:13:21.1 S2: them.

0:13:21.9 S2: And

0:13:22.4 S2: one

0:13:22.7 S2: night

0:13:23.0 S2: she

0:13:23.2 S2: decides,

0:13:24.1 S2: when

0:13:24.3 S2: it's

0:13:24.7 S2: pitch

0:13:25.3 S2: black

0:13:25.9 S2: and

0:13:26.2 S2: only

0:13:26.6 S2: the

0:13:26.9 S2: Milky

0:13:26.9 S2: Way's

0:13:26.9 S2: out,

0:13:26.9 S2: that

0:13:26.9 S2: she'll

0:13:26.9 S2: head

0:13:27.1 S2: back.

0:13:31.0 S1: And

0:13:30.5 S1: when

0:13:30.6 S1: she's

0:13:30.9 S1: heading

0:13:31.2 S1: back,

0:13:31.5 S1: she

0:13:31.7 S1: is

0:13:32.4 S1: driving

0:13:32.8 S1: through

0:13:33.0 S1: the

0:13:33.6 S1: old

0:13:34.2 S1: part

0:13:34.4 S1: of

0:13:34.6 S1: the

0:13:34.8 S1: swamp

0:13:35.1 S1: she

0:13:35.4 S1: said

0:13:35.7 S1: she

0:13:35.9 S1: hasn't

0:13:36.3 S1: visited

0:13:36.7 S1: in

0:13:36.9 S1: three

0:13:37.2 S1: years,

0:13:37.6 S1: she

0:13:37.8 S1: used

0:13:38.1 S1: to

0:13:38.2 S1: call

0:13:38.6 S1: home.

0:13:39.4 S1: And

0:13:39.6 S1: she

0:13:39.7 S1: gets

0:13:40.0 S1: really

0:13:40.2 S1: homesick,

0:13:40.9 S1: and

0:13:41.0 S1: she's

0:13:41.3 S1: really

0:13:41.6 S1: looking

0:13:41.9 S1: forward

0:13:42.4 S1: to

0:13:42.6 S1: find

0:13:43.4 S1: her

0:13:43.7 S1: parents.

0:13:44.6 S1: But

0:13:44.8 S1: when

0:13:44.9 S1: she

0:13:45.1 S1: gets

0:13:45.2 S1: to

0:13:45.3 S1: the

0:13:45.5 S1: place

0:13:45.7 S1: where

0:13:45.9 S1: their

0:13:46.2 S1: house

0:13:46.5 S1: used

0:13:46.7 S1: to

0:13:46.8 S1: be,

0:13:47.9 S1: there's

0:13:48.2 S1: just

0:13:48.5 S1: ruins.

0:13:49.5 S1: No

0:13:49.7 S1: one

0:13:49.8 S1: is

0:13:50.0 S1: there,

0:13:50.7 S1: the

0:13:50.8 S1: place

0:13:51.1 S1: is

0:13:51.3 S1: empty.

0:13:52.1 S1: Everything

0:13:52.5 S1: is

0:13:52.6 S1: ran

0:13:52.9 S1: down,

0:13:53.1 S1: everything's

0:13:56.8 S1: broken.

0:13:58.5 S2: And

0:13:58.6 S2: it's

0:13:58.6 S2: horribly

0:13:58.6 S2: flooded.

0:13:58.6 S2: Everything

0:13:58.8 S2: is...

0:13:59.9 S2: You

0:14:01.3 S2: can

0:14:02.4 S2: just

0:14:03.1 S2: see

0:14:03.4 S2: the

0:14:03.6 S2: line

0:14:04.0 S2: on

0:14:04.2 S2: the

0:14:04.5 S2: walls

0:14:04.8 S2: from

0:14:05.0 S2: the

0:14:05.2 S2: flood.

0:14:06.5 S2: And

0:14:06.7 S2: Sally

0:14:07.2 S2: thinks

0:14:07.5 S2: to

0:14:07.5 S2: herself

0:14:08.0 S2: and

0:14:08.2 S2: realizes

0:14:09.1 S2: that,

0:14:10.2 S2: just

0:14:10.6 S2: a

0:14:10.8 S2: few

0:14:11.1 S2: months

0:14:11.6 S2: before,

0:14:12.1 S2: there

0:14:12.3 S2: had

0:14:12.4 S2: been

0:14:12.6 S2: a

0:14:12.8 S2: terrible

0:14:13.4 S2: flood

0:14:13.7 S2: from

0:14:13.9 S2: a

0:14:14.0 S2: hurricane.

0:14:15.2 S2: And

0:14:15.3 S2: that

0:14:15.9 S2: she

0:14:15.9 S2: had

0:14:15.9 S2: survived

0:14:16.4 S2: it

0:14:16.6 S2: without

0:14:17.1 S2: any

0:14:18.5 S2: second-

0:14:18.9 S2: thought

0:14:19.3 S2: because

0:14:19.6 S2: she

0:14:19.8 S2: had

0:14:20.0 S2: been

0:14:20.2 S2: living

0:14:20.6 S2: in

0:14:20.7 S2: her

0:14:20.8 S2: tree

0:14:21.4 S2: house.

0:14:21.9 S2: And

0:14:22.1 S2: had

0:14:22.3 S2: barely

0:14:22.6 S2: even

0:14:23.0 S2: noticed

0:14:23.8 S2: that

0:14:24.1 S2: anything

0:14:24.6 S2: had

0:14:24.9 S2: flooded.

0:14:27.7 S1: So

0:14:27.9 S1: her

0:14:28.7 S1: only

0:14:29.0 S1: hope

0:14:29.2 S1: to

0:14:29.3 S1: find

0:14:29.6 S1: her

0:14:29.7 S1: parents

0:14:30.1 S1: right

0:14:30.3 S1: now

0:14:30.5 S1: is

0:14:31.1 S1: to

0:14:31.3 S1: assume

0:14:31.8 S1: that

0:14:32.0 S1: they

0:14:32.2 S1: went

0:14:32.4 S1: on

0:14:32.6 S1: some

0:14:32.9 S1: kind

0:14:33.1 S1: of

0:14:33.2 S1: boat

0:14:33.9 S1: and

0:14:34.8 S1: lived

0:14:35.1 S1: on

0:14:35.2 S1: the

0:14:35.4 S1: boat,

0:14:35.8 S1: and

0:14:36.1 S1: try

0:14:36.3 S1: to

0:14:37.6 S1: sit

0:14:37.8 S1: out

0:14:38.0 S1: the

0:14:38.3 S1: storm

0:14:38.7 S1: and

0:14:38.9 S1: the

0:14:39.2 S1: flood

0:14:39.5 S1: in

0:14:39.6 S1: the

0:14:40.0 S1: boat.

0:14:42.1 S1: But

0:14:42.3 S1: there

0:14:42.5 S1: is

0:14:42.5 S1: no

0:14:42.7 S1: boat

0:14:43.0 S1: to

0:14:43.1 S1: be

0:14:43.2 S1: seen

0:14:43.5 S1: anywhere,

0:14:44.6 S1: so

0:14:44.8 S1: she

0:14:45.0 S1: just

0:14:46.0 S1: sets

0:14:46.2 S1: out

0:14:47.1 S1: and

0:14:47.5 S1: drives

0:14:47.8 S1: her

0:14:48.0 S1: boat

0:14:48.4 S1: off

0:14:48.7 S1: into

0:14:49.0 S1: the

0:14:49.1 S1: sunset

0:14:50.2 S1: on

0:14:50.3 S1: the

0:14:50.5 S1: search

0:14:50.8 S1: for

0:14:51.0 S1: her

0:14:51.1 S1: parents.

0:14:52.5 S1: And

0:14:52.7 S1: in

0:14:53.0 S1: Part

0:14:53.5 S1: two

0:14:53.8 S1: she

0:14:54.0 S1: might

0:14:54.4 S1: realize

0:14:55.2 S1: or

0:14:55.4 S1: she

0:14:55.5 S1: might

0:14:55.9 S1: reconnect

0:14:56.4 S1: with

0:14:56.5 S1: Bruce

0:14:56.5 S1: Willis

0:14:56.5 S1: who's

0:14:56.5 S1: help...
