0:00:00.0 S1: Alright,

0:00:02.1 S1: so

0:00:02.6 S1: the

0:00:02.9 S1: scene

0:00:03.4 S1: opens

0:00:04.5 S1: on

0:00:04.7 S1: a

0:00:04.9 S1: small

0:00:05.5 S1: town

0:00:06.2 S1: in

0:00:06.4 S1: Nebraska,

0:00:08.0 S1: and

0:00:08.3 S1: there's

0:00:08.6 S1: a

0:00:08.8 S1: family

0:00:09.3 S1: in

0:00:09.5 S1: that

0:00:09.8 S1: town

0:00:10.4 S1: with

0:00:10.8 S1: six

0:00:11.2 S1: kids.

0:00:12.2 S1: And

0:00:12.3 S1: their

0:00:12.5 S1: house

0:00:12.8 S1: is

0:00:13.1 S1: small,

0:00:13.5 S1: they

0:00:13.6 S1: have

0:00:14.0 S1: three

0:00:14.4 S1: bedrooms

0:00:16.5 S1: and

0:00:16.7 S1: one

0:00:17.0 S1: bathroom,

0:00:17.7 S1: and

0:00:17.9 S1: all

0:00:18.3 S1: six

0:00:18.6 S1: kids

0:00:18.9 S1: have

0:00:19.2 S1: to

0:00:19.3 S1: share

0:00:19.6 S1: the

0:00:19.7 S1: bathroom

0:00:20.2 S1: in

0:00:20.3 S1: the

0:00:20.4 S1: morning

0:00:20.8 S1: to

0:00:21.0 S1: get

0:00:21.1 S1: ready.

0:00:22.1 S1: And

0:00:22.3 S1: it

0:00:22.5 S1: usually

0:00:22.9 S1: is

0:00:23.2 S1: chaotic,

0:00:23.9 S1: but

0:00:24.1 S1: somehow

0:00:24.6 S1: they're

0:00:24.8 S1: making

0:00:25.1 S1: it

0:00:25.3 S1: work,

0:00:25.7 S1: and

0:00:25.9 S1: have

0:00:26.1 S1: been

0:00:26.4 S1: for

0:00:26.6 S1: a

0:00:26.7 S1: while.

0:00:30.4 S2: So

0:00:30.6 S2: usually

0:00:31.0 S2: it

0:00:31.1 S2: works

0:00:31.4 S2: out

0:00:32.3 S2: pretty

0:00:32.5 S2: well

0:00:32.7 S2: with

0:00:32.9 S2: this

0:00:33.1 S2: family,

0:00:35.1 S2: but

0:00:35.4 S2: this

0:00:35.7 S2: morning,

0:00:36.8 S2: the

0:00:38.0 S2: youngest

0:00:38.4 S2: child,

0:00:39.8 S2: Timmy,

0:00:41.1 S2: really

0:00:41.4 S2: needs

0:00:41.6 S2: to

0:00:42.1 S2: use

0:00:42.3 S2: the

0:00:42.4 S2: bathroom,

0:00:43.9 S2: but

0:00:44.0 S2: his

0:00:44.2 S2: older

0:00:44.6 S2: sister's

0:00:45.0 S2: in

0:00:45.1 S2: there

0:00:46.7 S2: doing

0:00:47.0 S2: her

0:00:47.1 S2: hair

0:00:47.3 S2: and

0:00:47.5 S2: makeup.

0:00:48.3 S2: And

0:00:49.7 S2: he's

0:00:49.9 S2: telling

0:00:50.1 S2: her

0:00:50.2 S2: that

0:00:50.3 S2: he

0:00:50.5 S2: really

0:00:50.7 S2: needs

0:00:50.9 S2: to

0:00:51.0 S2: go,

0:00:53.1 S2: but

0:00:53.6 S2: she

0:00:53.7 S2: won't

0:00:53.9 S2: get

0:00:54.0 S2: out

0:00:54.1 S2: of

0:00:54.2 S2: the

0:00:54.3 S2: bathroom.

0:00:55.5 S2: And

0:00:55.9 S2: Timmy's

0:00:56.9 S2: sitting

0:00:57.1 S2: outside

0:00:58.2 S2: really

0:00:58.4 S2: frustrated

0:00:59.0 S2: and

0:00:59.1 S2: really

0:00:59.3 S2: needs

0:00:59.4 S2: to

0:00:59.5 S2: use

0:00:59.7 S2: the

0:00:59.8 S2: bathroom.

0:01:00.4 S1: Timmy's

0:01:00.9 S1: sitting

0:01:01.4 S1: there

0:01:01.8 S1: and

0:01:02.1 S1: he's

0:01:02.4 S1: knocking

0:01:03.0 S1: on

0:01:03.1 S1: the

0:01:03.3 S1: door

0:01:03.5 S1: and

0:01:03.7 S1: he's

0:01:03.9 S1: banging

0:01:04.3 S1: on

0:01:04.4 S1: the

0:01:04.6 S1: door,

0:01:05.0 S1: and

0:01:05.2 S1: he's

0:01:05.5 S1: kicking

0:01:06.0 S1: the

0:01:06.1 S1: door,

0:01:06.5 S1: and

0:01:06.7 S1: his

0:01:06.9 S1: sister,

0:01:07.5 S1: Stephanie,

0:01:08.0 S1: is

0:01:08.2 S1: inside

0:01:09.3 S1: just

0:01:09.6 S1: doing

0:01:09.9 S1: her

0:01:10.1 S1: hair

0:01:10.4 S1: and

0:01:10.7 S1: makeup

0:01:11.0 S1: like

0:01:11.2 S1: every

0:01:11.5 S1: other

0:01:11.7 S1: day,

0:01:12.1 S1: until

0:01:12.5 S1: Timmy

0:01:13.0 S1: decides

0:01:13.6 S1: that

0:01:13.9 S1: it's

0:01:14.3 S1: time

0:01:14.6 S1: to

0:01:15.1 S1: take

0:01:15.1 S1: charge

0:01:16.1 S1: and

0:01:16.3 S1: reclaim

0:01:16.9 S1: his

0:01:17.2 S1: bathroom

0:01:17.6 S1: privileges.

0:01:18.6 S1: Because

0:01:19.2 S1: as

0:01:19.4 S1: the

0:01:19.5 S1: youngest,

0:01:20.3 S1: he

0:01:20.5 S1: always

0:01:21.0 S1: goes

0:01:21.3 S1: last.

0:01:22.7 S1: So

0:01:23.8 S1: he

0:01:24.0 S1: gears

0:01:24.3 S1: himself

0:01:24.7 S1: up

0:01:25.4 S1: and

0:01:25.5 S1: goes

0:01:25.8 S1: outside

0:01:26.6 S1: and

0:01:26.8 S1: gets

0:01:27.0 S1: the

0:01:27.3 S1: hose

0:01:27.6 S1: from

0:01:27.8 S1: the

0:01:27.9 S1: garden.

0:01:30.6 S2: So

0:01:30.8 S2: Timmy

0:01:31.0 S2: is

0:01:32.0 S2: outside,

0:01:32.6 S2: he's

0:01:32.8 S2: got

0:01:33.0 S2: the

0:01:33.1 S2: garden

0:01:33.5 S2: hose.

0:01:35.1 S2: He's

0:01:35.3 S2: coming

0:01:35.6 S2: back

0:01:35.8 S2: in

0:01:35.9 S2: the

0:01:36.0 S2: house

0:01:36.4 S2: dragging

0:01:36.7 S2: this

0:01:36.9 S2: hose

0:01:38.1 S2: back

0:01:38.4 S2: into

0:01:38.6 S2: the

0:01:38.7 S2: house.

0:01:40.4 S2: He

0:01:40.6 S2: drags

0:01:40.9 S2: it

0:01:41.0 S2: up

0:01:41.2 S2: to

0:01:41.3 S2: the

0:01:41.5 S2: bathroom,

0:01:43.0 S2: and

0:01:43.1 S2: he's

0:01:43.3 S2: waiting

0:01:43.6 S2: outside

0:01:43.9 S2: the

0:01:44.1 S2: bathroom

0:01:44.5 S2: door

0:01:45.9 S2: with

0:01:46.0 S2: the

0:01:46.2 S2: hose.

0:01:48.2 S2: And

0:01:50.1 S2: he

0:01:50.3 S2: kicks

0:01:50.5 S2: the

0:01:50.6 S2: door

0:01:50.8 S2: open

0:01:51.7 S2: and

0:01:52.0 S2: the

0:01:52.2 S2: sister

0:01:52.7 S2: is

0:01:52.8 S2: sitting

0:01:53.1 S2: there

0:01:53.3 S2: shocked,

0:01:54.4 S2: and

0:01:54.9 S2: he

0:01:55.2 S2: turns

0:01:55.4 S2: the

0:01:55.6 S2: hose

0:01:55.8 S2: on

0:01:56.4 S2: and

0:01:56.5 S2: unleashes

0:01:58.4 S2: this

0:01:59.1 S2: cold

0:01:59.4 S2: water

0:01:59.8 S2: mass

0:02:00.1 S2: on

0:02:01.0 S2: her.

0:02:02.0 S1: And

0:02:02.2 S1: first,

0:02:02.5 S1: he

0:02:02.7 S1: starts

0:02:03.0 S1: with

0:02:03.1 S1: her

0:02:03.4 S1: shoes,

0:02:03.7 S1: 'cause

0:02:04.0 S1: they're

0:02:04.3 S1: her

0:02:04.5 S1: good

0:02:04.7 S1: shoes,

0:02:05.0 S1: her

0:02:05.2 S1: school

0:02:05.5 S1: shoes,

0:02:06.0 S1: and

0:02:06.2 S1: since

0:02:06.4 S1: their

0:02:06.7 S1: family

0:02:07.0 S1: doesn't

0:02:07.3 S1: have

0:02:07.4 S1: a

0:02:07.5 S1: lot

0:02:07.7 S1: of

0:02:07.7 S1: money,

0:02:08.4 S1: they

0:02:08.6 S1: all

0:02:08.8 S1: just

0:02:09.0 S1: have

0:02:09.2 S1: one

0:02:09.5 S1: nice

0:02:09.9 S1: pair

0:02:10.4 S1: of

0:02:10.6 S1: shoes.

0:02:11.2 S1: And

0:02:11.3 S1: as

0:02:11.7 S1: she

0:02:11.9 S1: starts

0:02:12.3 S1: screaming

0:02:12.7 S1: and

0:02:12.9 S1: yelling,

0:02:13.5 S1: everyone

0:02:13.9 S1: else

0:02:14.1 S1: in

0:02:14.2 S1: the

0:02:14.3 S1: family

0:02:14.7 S1: can

0:02:15.1 S1: hear,

0:02:15.8 S1: and

0:02:15.9 S1: some

0:02:16.1 S1: other

0:02:16.4 S1: siblings

0:02:16.9 S1: come

0:02:17.1 S1: running.

0:02:18.0 S1: And

0:02:18.2 S1: as

0:02:18.3 S1: they

0:02:18.5 S1: come

0:02:18.7 S1: running

0:02:19.7 S1: and

0:02:19.9 S1: she's

0:02:20.8 S1: yelling

0:02:21.2 S1: and

0:02:21.4 S1: he's

0:02:21.8 S1: yelling,

0:02:22.3 S1: he

0:02:22.5 S1: starts

0:02:22.9 S1: working

0:02:23.2 S1: the

0:02:23.4 S1: hose

0:02:24.0 S1: up

0:02:24.3 S1: towards

0:02:24.7 S1: her

0:02:24.9 S1: perfectly

0:02:25.4 S1: coiffed

0:02:26.2 S1: hair

0:02:26.5 S1: and

0:02:26.7 S1: expertly

0:02:27.3 S1: done

0:02:27.6 S1: make-

0:02:27.8 S1: up.

0:02:31.2 S2: So

0:02:31.9 S2: at

0:02:32.1 S2: this

0:02:32.4 S2: point,

0:02:32.8 S2: the

0:02:32.9 S2: water

0:02:34.0 S2: is

0:02:34.1 S2: going

0:02:34.3 S2: all

0:02:34.4 S2: over

0:02:34.6 S2: her

0:02:34.9 S2: face,

0:02:35.3 S2: her

0:02:35.6 S2: makeup

0:02:36.2 S2: is

0:02:36.3 S2: running

0:02:36.6 S2: down

0:02:36.8 S2: her

0:02:37.0 S2: face,

0:02:37.4 S2: and

0:02:37.6 S2: all

0:02:37.8 S2: of

0:02:37.9 S2: her

0:02:38.0 S2: brothers

0:02:38.4 S2: and

0:02:38.6 S2: sisters

0:02:39.6 S2: are

0:02:40.0 S2: also

0:02:40.4 S2: watching,

0:02:42.0 S2: and

0:02:43.6 S2: this

0:02:43.8 S2: huge

0:02:44.1 S2: fight

0:02:44.3 S2: breaks

0:02:44.6 S2: out,

0:02:44.9 S2: because

0:02:45.2 S2: it

0:02:45.3 S2: turns

0:02:45.5 S2: out,

0:02:45.7 S2: some

0:02:45.9 S2: of

0:02:46.0 S2: the

0:02:46.1 S2: other

0:02:46.4 S2: siblings

0:02:47.3 S2: have

0:02:47.5 S2: also

0:02:47.8 S2: been

0:02:47.9 S2: frustrated

0:02:48.4 S2: with

0:02:48.5 S2: this

0:02:48.8 S2: sister

0:02:49.0 S2: for

0:02:49.1 S2: a

0:02:49.2 S2: long

0:02:49.5 S2: time,

0:02:50.1 S2: so

0:02:50.2 S2: they

0:02:50.4 S2: want

0:02:50.6 S2: Timmy

0:02:50.9 S2: to

0:02:51.0 S2: keep

0:02:51.2 S2: hosing

0:02:51.6 S2: her

0:02:51.7 S2: down,

0:02:52.5 S2: and

0:02:53.6 S2: the

0:02:53.7 S2: other

0:02:54.0 S2: siblings

0:02:54.3 S2: are

0:02:54.5 S2: telling

0:02:54.7 S2: him

0:02:54.8 S2: to

0:02:54.9 S2: stop,

0:02:55.2 S2: and

0:02:55.4 S2: pretty

0:02:55.7 S2: soon,

0:02:55.9 S2: this

0:02:56.1 S2: huge

0:02:56.5 S2: fight

0:02:56.7 S2: just

0:02:56.8 S2: breaks

0:02:57.2 S2: out.

0:02:57.9 S2: And

0:02:58.1 S2: it's

0:02:58.2 S2: all

0:02:58.4 S2: Timmy's

0:02:59.6 S2: fault.

0:03:00.3 S1: Of

0:03:00.4 S1: course,

0:03:00.7 S1: it's

0:03:00.9 S1: Timmy's

0:03:01.2 S1: fault.

0:03:01.5 S1: He's

0:03:01.7 S1: the

0:03:01.9 S1: youngest

0:03:02.3 S1: and

0:03:02.4 S1: the

0:03:02.6 S1: trouble

0:03:03.2 S1: maker.

0:03:03.7 S1: And

0:03:03.9 S1: so

0:03:04.0 S1: they're

0:03:04.2 S1: arguing

0:03:04.7 S1: and

0:03:04.9 S1: deciding,

0:03:05.6 S1: and

0:03:05.8 S1: finally,

0:03:06.5 S1: the

0:03:06.9 S1: second

0:03:07.5 S1: youngest

0:03:08.3 S1: sibling,

0:03:09.0 S1: Jennifer,

0:03:09.9 S1: decides

0:03:10.7 S1: that

0:03:11.1 S1: instead

0:03:11.5 S1: of

0:03:11.7 S1: fighting,

0:03:12.1 S1: they

0:03:12.3 S1: should

0:03:12.6 S1: have

0:03:12.8 S1: a

0:03:12.8 S1: family

0:03:13.2 S1: meeting

0:03:14.1 S1: and

0:03:14.3 S1: decide

0:03:15.0 S1: how

0:03:15.4 S1: and

0:03:15.8 S1: when

0:03:16.2 S1: to

0:03:16.3 S1: do

0:03:16.5 S1: bathroom

0:03:17.0 S1: privileges.

0:03:18.2 S1: And

0:03:18.3 S1: while

0:03:18.6 S1: she's

0:03:18.8 S1: trying

0:03:19.0 S1: to

0:03:19.1 S1: organize

0:03:19.6 S1: the

0:03:19.8 S1: meeting,

0:03:20.3 S1: Timmy

0:03:20.7 S1: turns

0:03:21.1 S1: the

0:03:21.3 S1: hose

0:03:21.6 S1: on

0:03:21.8 S1: her.

0:03:22.9 S1: And

0:03:23.1 S1: so

0:03:23.3 S1: now

0:03:23.6 S1: two

0:03:23.9 S1: siblings

0:03:24.5 S1: are

0:03:24.7 S1: very

0:03:25.0 S1: damp,

0:03:25.4 S1: and

0:03:26.0 S1: the

0:03:26.2 S1: parents

0:03:26.6 S1: downstairs

0:03:27.3 S1: can

0:03:27.4 S1: hear

0:03:27.7 S1: what's

0:03:28.0 S1: happening.

0:03:30.8 S2: So

0:03:31.0 S2: the

0:03:31.1 S2: parents

0:03:31.7 S2: downstairs

0:03:32.7 S2: are

0:03:33.2 S2: Timmy

0:03:34.1 S2: Sr.

0:03:34.4 S2: And

0:03:34.7 S2: Donna.

0:03:35.4 S2: And

0:03:37.5 S2: they

0:03:37.6 S2: hear

0:03:37.9 S2: this,

0:03:38.2 S2: this

0:03:38.6 S2: crazy

0:03:39.2 S2: commotion

0:03:40.1 S2: coming

0:03:40.1 S2: from

0:03:40.2 S2: upstairs,

0:03:41.0 S2: and

0:03:41.3 S2: the

0:03:41.4 S2: dad

0:03:42.9 S2: looks

0:03:43.2 S2: out

0:03:43.3 S2: the

0:03:43.5 S2: door

0:03:43.8 S2: and

0:03:43.9 S2: he

0:03:44.0 S2: sees

0:03:44.2 S2: the

0:03:44.3 S2: door's

0:03:44.6 S2: open,

0:03:44.9 S2: and

0:03:45.1 S2: he

0:03:45.2 S2: sees

0:03:46.1 S2: a

0:03:46.5 S2: hose

0:03:47.2 S2: running

0:03:47.4 S2: outside

0:03:47.8 S2: from

0:03:48.0 S2: the

0:03:48.2 S2: garden

0:03:49.0 S2: up

0:03:49.2 S2: the

0:03:49.3 S2: stairs

0:03:49.6 S2: into

0:03:49.8 S2: the

0:03:50.0 S2: bathroom.

0:03:50.7 S2: So

0:03:50.8 S2: he

0:03:51.0 S2: follows

0:03:51.3 S2: the

0:03:51.5 S2: hose

0:03:51.8 S2: up,

0:03:52.1 S2: follows

0:03:52.5 S2: the

0:03:52.7 S2: screams,

0:03:53.4 S2: and

0:03:54.1 S2: see

0:03:54.8 S2: Timmy

0:03:55.9 S2: hosing

0:03:57.2 S2: his

0:03:57.8 S2: two

0:03:58.0 S2: sisters

0:03:58.4 S2: and

0:03:58.5 S2: everyone

0:03:58.8 S2: else

0:03:58.9 S2: was

0:03:59.1 S2: just

0:03:59.3 S2: screaming.

0:04:00.9 S1: And

0:04:01.3 S1: so

0:04:01.7 S1: Timmy

0:04:02.5 S1: Sr

0:04:02.9 S1: takes

0:04:03.7 S1: charge

0:04:04.6 S1: and

0:04:04.7 S1: tells

0:04:05.0 S1: all

0:04:05.2 S1: the

0:04:05.3 S1: kids

0:04:05.6 S1: to

0:04:05.9 S1: get

0:04:06.1 S1: downstairs

0:04:06.7 S1: into

0:04:07.5 S1: the

0:04:08.1 S1: kitchen,

0:04:09.4 S1: ASAP.

0:04:10.1 S1: And

0:04:10.5 S1: so

0:04:10.7 S1: they

0:04:10.9 S1: all

0:04:11.5 S1: turned

0:04:11.7 S1: off

0:04:11.8 S1: the

0:04:11.9 S1: hose

0:04:12.2 S1: and

0:04:12.4 S1: put

0:04:12.6 S1: the

0:04:12.7 S1: hose

0:04:13.0 S1: back

0:04:13.3 S1: and

0:04:13.5 S1: head

0:04:13.9 S1: downstairs

0:04:14.9 S1: for

0:04:15.1 S1: what

0:04:15.2 S1: will

0:04:15.4 S1: be

0:04:15.6 S1: a

0:04:15.7 S1: brief,

0:04:16.2 S1: because

0:04:16.9 S1: school

0:04:17.2 S1: is

0:04:17.4 S1: coming

0:04:17.6 S1: up,

0:04:18.2 S1: but

0:04:18.4 S1: informative

0:04:19.1 S1: family

0:04:19.4 S1: meeting.

0:04:20.4 S1: And

0:04:20.5 S1: so

0:04:20.7 S1: they're

0:04:20.9 S1: all

0:04:21.0 S1: sitting

0:04:21.3 S1: downstairs,

0:04:22.0 S1: mostly

0:04:22.4 S1: drenched,

0:04:23.1 S1: and

0:04:23.3 S1: Donna's

0:04:23.7 S1: handing

0:04:24.1 S1: out

0:04:24.3 S1: small

0:04:24.6 S1: towels,

0:04:25.7 S1: and

0:04:25.8 S1: the

0:04:25.9 S1: meeting

0:04:26.4 S1: begins,

0:04:27.1 S1: and

0:04:27.3 S1: everyone

0:04:27.7 S1: can

0:04:27.9 S1: tell

0:04:28.0 S1: it's

0:04:28.3 S1: gonna

0:04:28.5 S1: be

0:04:28.7 S1: one

0:04:28.8 S1: of

0:04:28.9 S1: their

0:04:29.1 S1: more

0:04:29.3 S1: tense

0:04:29.7 S1: meetings.

0:04:31.8 S2: Yeah,

0:04:32.1 S2: so

0:04:32.2 S2: the

0:04:32.4 S2: dad

0:04:32.6 S2: just

0:04:32.8 S2: starts

0:04:33.1 S2: saying...

0:04:33.8 S2: He's

0:04:34.0 S2: pretty

0:04:34.2 S2: mad

0:04:34.4 S2: at

0:04:34.6 S2: Timmy.

0:04:35.6 S2: He's

0:04:35.7 S2: upset

0:04:36.1 S2: that

0:04:36.9 S2: the

0:04:37.1 S2: eldest

0:04:37.4 S2: sister

0:04:37.7 S2: wasn't

0:04:39.4 S2: sharing

0:04:39.6 S2: the

0:04:39.8 S2: bathroom

0:04:40.2 S2: like

0:04:40.3 S2: she

0:04:40.4 S2: should

0:04:40.6 S2: have

0:04:40.7 S2: been,

0:04:40.9 S2: but

0:04:40.9 S2: he's

0:04:41.1 S2: really

0:04:41.2 S2: upset

0:04:41.6 S2: with

0:04:41.7 S2: Timmy,

0:04:42.1 S2: because

0:04:42.4 S2: he

0:04:42.5 S2: brought

0:04:42.7 S2: the

0:04:42.8 S2: hose

0:04:43.1 S2: in

0:04:43.2 S2: the

0:04:43.3 S2: house,

0:04:44.2 S2: and

0:04:45.0 S2: they

0:04:45.2 S2: had

0:04:45.4 S2: wood

0:04:45.7 S2: floors

0:04:46.1 S2: in

0:04:46.2 S2: the

0:04:46.4 S2: upstairs

0:04:47.1 S2: and

0:04:47.2 S2: now

0:04:47.4 S2: there's

0:04:47.7 S2: water

0:04:50.2 S2: soaking

0:04:50.6 S2: in

0:04:50.9 S2: all

0:04:51.0 S2: over

0:04:51.2 S2: the

0:04:51.4 S2: floor

0:04:51.8 S2: boards.

0:04:52.8 S2: And

0:04:53.7 S2: he's

0:04:53.9 S2: really

0:04:54.1 S2: upset,

0:04:54.4 S2: because

0:04:54.8 S2: Timmy

0:04:55.1 S2: probably

0:04:55.4 S2: did

0:04:55.6 S2: a

0:04:55.7 S2: couple

0:04:55.9 S2: of

0:04:56.0 S2: thousand

0:04:56.3 S2: dollars

0:04:56.6 S2: worth

0:04:56.9 S2: of

0:04:57.1 S2: damage

0:04:57.4 S2: to

0:04:57.5 S2: the

0:04:57.6 S2: house,

0:04:57.9 S2: and

0:04:58.1 S2: they

0:04:58.2 S2: just

0:04:58.4 S2: can't

0:04:58.6 S2: afford

0:04:58.8 S2: to

0:04:59.0 S2: repair

0:04:59.3 S2: that.

0:05:01.8 S1: So

0:05:02.1 S1: Timmy,

0:05:03.5 S1: immediately,

0:05:04.4 S1: is

0:05:04.6 S1: super

0:05:05.1 S1: grounded,

0:05:06.1 S1: just

0:05:06.7 S1: flat

0:05:07.0 S1: out

0:05:07.4 S1: probably

0:05:07.7 S1: for

0:05:07.8 S1: the

0:05:07.9 S1: rest

0:05:08.1 S1: of

0:05:08.2 S1: his

0:05:08.4 S1: life.

0:05:09.5 S1: And

0:05:09.9 S1: makeup

0:05:10.6 S1: privileges

0:05:11.2 S1: are

0:05:11.5 S1: taken

0:05:11.8 S1: away

0:05:12.5 S1: from

0:05:12.8 S1: Stephanie,

0:05:13.3 S1: the

0:05:13.4 S1: oldest

0:05:13.8 S1: sister.

0:05:14.9 S1: And

0:05:15.2 S1: Jennifer

0:05:15.6 S1: is

0:05:15.8 S1: reminded

0:05:16.9 S1: that

0:05:17.1 S1: she

0:05:17.2 S1: is

0:05:17.4 S1: not

0:05:17.6 S1: in

0:05:17.8 S1: charge

0:05:18.1 S1: of

0:05:18.2 S1: this

0:05:18.5 S1: family.

0:05:19.6 S1: So

0:05:20.2 S1: those

0:05:20.4 S1: are

0:05:20.5 S1: the

0:05:20.7 S1: easy

0:05:21.0 S1: punishments,

0:05:21.7 S1: but

0:05:22.0 S1: Timmy

0:05:22.4 S1: Sr,

0:05:22.6 S1: and

0:05:22.8 S1: Donna

0:05:23.2 S1: both

0:05:23.5 S1: know

0:05:23.7 S1: that

0:05:23.9 S1: something

0:05:24.2 S1: more

0:05:24.4 S1: drastic

0:05:25.0 S1: needs

0:05:25.3 S1: to

0:05:25.4 S1: be

0:05:25.5 S1: done

0:05:26.6 S1: regarding

0:05:27.1 S1: their

0:05:27.3 S1: family

0:05:27.7 S1: bathroom

0:05:28.2 S1: situation.

0:05:29.7 S2: So

0:05:30.7 S2: at

0:05:30.9 S2: this

0:05:31.2 S2: point,

0:05:32.3 S2: little

0:05:32.6 S2: Timmy

0:05:33.8 S2: is

0:05:34.1 S2: really

0:05:34.5 S2: just

0:05:34.8 S2: not

0:05:35.0 S2: having

0:05:35.3 S2: it

0:05:35.8 S2: and

0:05:36.1 S2: he's

0:05:37.2 S2: just

0:05:37.2 S2: not

0:05:37.4 S2: happy

0:05:37.7 S2: with

0:05:37.8 S2: his

0:05:38.0 S2: punishment.

0:05:40.1 S2: And

0:05:40.7 S2: he

0:05:40.9 S2: storms

0:05:41.3 S2: out

0:05:41.4 S2: of

0:05:41.5 S2: the

0:05:41.7 S2: family

0:05:42.0 S2: meeting,

0:05:43.1 S2: and

0:05:43.5 S2: he

0:05:43.7 S2: runs

0:05:43.9 S2: up

0:05:44.1 S2: to

0:05:44.5 S2: his

0:05:45.2 S2: room,

0:05:45.8 S2: and

0:05:46.1 S2: he

0:05:46.3 S2: locks

0:05:46.5 S2: himself

0:05:47.0 S2: in,

0:05:48.6 S2: and

0:05:50.4 S2: his

0:05:50.6 S2: dad

0:05:50.8 S2: starts

0:05:51.1 S2: yelling

0:05:51.4 S2: at

0:05:51.8 S2: him,

0:05:52.1 S2: and

0:05:52.4 S2: he's

0:05:53.1 S2: coming

0:05:53.4 S2: up

0:05:53.5 S2: the

0:05:53.7 S2: stairs

0:05:54.4 S2: to

0:05:55.0 S2: try

0:05:55.2 S2: to

0:05:55.6 S2: get

0:05:55.8 S2: Timmy

0:05:56.1 S2: back

0:05:56.3 S2: out

0:05:56.5 S2: of

0:05:56.5 S2: his

0:05:56.7 S2: room

0:05:57.1 S2: to

0:05:58.2 S2: continue

0:05:58.6 S2: the

0:05:58.7 S2: meeting.

0:06:00.2 S1: But

0:05:59.8 S1: Timmy's

0:06:01.0 S1: stubborn,

0:06:02.3 S1: as

0:06:02.5 S1: we

0:06:02.7 S1: know,

0:06:03.4 S1: and

0:06:03.9 S1: so

0:06:04.1 S1: Timmy

0:06:04.9 S1: Sr.

0:06:05.4 S1: Is

0:06:05.8 S1: trying

0:06:06.6 S1: to

0:06:06.8 S1: reason

0:06:07.1 S1: with

0:06:07.2 S1: him

0:06:07.4 S1: through

0:06:07.7 S1: the

0:06:07.8 S1: bedroom

0:06:08.3 S1: door.

0:06:10.0 S1: Because

0:06:10.3 S1: this

0:06:10.5 S1: isn't

0:06:10.8 S1: just

0:06:11.0 S1: Timmy's

0:06:11.5 S1: room,

0:06:11.7 S1: it's

0:06:12.1 S1: some

0:06:12.2 S1: other

0:06:12.5 S1: siblings'

0:06:13.0 S1: room

0:06:13.3 S1: as

0:06:13.5 S1: well,

0:06:13.9 S1: so

0:06:14.5 S1: they

0:06:14.7 S1: gotta

0:06:14.9 S1: get

0:06:15.0 S1: him

0:06:15.1 S1: out

0:06:15.9 S1: eventually.

0:06:17.1 S1: And

0:06:17.4 S1: Timmy

0:06:18.4 S1: Sr

0:06:18.8 S1: is

0:06:19.1 S1: trying

0:06:19.4 S1: to

0:06:19.5 S1: think

0:06:19.7 S1: of

0:06:19.8 S1: a

0:06:19.9 S1: way

0:06:20.8 S1: where

0:06:21.1 S1: they

0:06:21.3 S1: can

0:06:21.4 S1: make

0:06:21.6 S1: the

0:06:21.8 S1: money

0:06:22.1 S1: back

0:06:22.8 S1: and

0:06:23.7 S1: get

0:06:24.0 S1: Timmy

0:06:24.9 S1: Jr

0:06:25.2 S1: out

0:06:25.3 S1: of

0:06:25.5 S1: the

0:06:25.7 S1: room.

0:06:30.2 S2: So

0:06:30.4 S2: Timmy

0:06:30.7 S2: Sr

0:06:30.9 S2: is

0:06:31.1 S2: thinking

0:06:31.3 S2: of

0:06:31.5 S2: a

0:06:31.6 S2: way

0:06:32.0 S2: that

0:06:32.3 S2: he

0:06:32.4 S2: can

0:06:32.6 S2: get

0:06:32.7 S2: the

0:06:32.9 S2: money

0:06:33.2 S2: back,

0:06:34.8 S2: and

0:06:36.7 S2: he

0:06:37.0 S2: tells

0:06:37.9 S2: Timmy

0:06:38.8 S2: Jr

0:06:40.4 S2: that

0:06:40.9 S2: they

0:06:41.2 S2: can

0:06:43.8 S2: open

0:06:44.2 S2: up

0:06:44.5 S2: a

0:06:45.3 S2: lemonade

0:06:45.9 S2: stand

0:06:46.3 S2: together.

0:06:47.9 S2: So

0:06:48.3 S2: Timmy

0:06:48.4 S2: Jr

0:06:48.4 S2: is

0:06:48.6 S2: now

0:06:48.8 S2: gonna

0:06:49.0 S2: have

0:06:49.1 S2: to

0:06:50.7 S2: run

0:06:50.8 S2: his

0:06:51.0 S2: own

0:06:51.2 S2: business,

0:06:51.8 S2: and

0:06:51.9 S2: it

0:06:52.0 S2: can

0:06:52.2 S2: be

0:06:52.3 S2: a

0:06:52.4 S2: lemonade

0:06:52.7 S2: stand

0:06:53.0 S2: if

0:06:53.2 S2: he

0:06:53.4 S2: wants,

0:06:53.8 S2: but

0:06:53.9 S2: his

0:06:54.1 S2: dad's

0:06:54.3 S2: also

0:06:55.2 S2: open

0:06:55.8 S2: to

0:06:56.1 S2: hearing

0:06:56.4 S2: other

0:06:56.6 S2: ideas

0:06:57.0 S2: about

0:06:57.3 S2: how

0:06:57.5 S2: he

0:06:57.6 S2: can

0:06:57.8 S2: work

0:06:58.0 S2: to

0:06:58.2 S2: make

0:06:58.4 S2: this

0:06:58.6 S2: money

0:06:59.0 S2: back.

0:07:01.4 S1: And

0:07:01.6 S1: Timmy

0:07:02.2 S1: Jr

0:07:02.4 S1: has

0:07:02.6 S1: an

0:07:02.7 S1: entrepreneurial

0:07:03.6 S1: heart,

0:07:04.1 S1: so

0:07:04.3 S1: this

0:07:04.6 S1: punishment

0:07:05.2 S1: sits

0:07:05.5 S1: well

0:07:05.8 S1: with

0:07:06.0 S1: him.

0:07:06.6 S1: And

0:07:07.0 S1: so,

0:07:07.9 S1: the

0:07:08.2 S1: two

0:07:08.8 S1: get

0:07:09.0 S1: to

0:07:09.1 S1: work,

0:07:09.6 S1: crafting

0:07:10.2 S1: what

0:07:10.3 S1: will

0:07:10.5 S1: be

0:07:10.7 S1: their

0:07:10.9 S1: family's

0:07:11.4 S1: small

0:07:11.7 S1: business.

0:07:13.1 S1: And

0:07:14.2 S1: since

0:07:14.4 S1: Timmy

0:07:14.5 S1: was

0:07:14.7 S1: so

0:07:15.0 S1: adept

0:07:15.5 S1: with

0:07:15.6 S1: the

0:07:15.7 S1: hose,

0:07:16.7 S1: they're

0:07:17.0 S1: going

0:07:17.1 S1: to

0:07:17.3 S1: make

0:07:17.5 S1: a

0:07:17.7 S1: combination,

0:07:18.6 S1: lemonade

0:07:19.3 S1: stand/pet

0:07:20.1 S1: wash/car

0:07:20.6 S1: wash

0:07:21.1 S1: station

0:07:21.6 S1: in

0:07:21.8 S1: their

0:07:22.0 S1: front

0:07:22.2 S1: yard

0:07:23.0 S1: to

0:07:23.1 S1: recoup

0:07:23.5 S1: the

0:07:23.7 S1: money

0:07:24.1 S1: and

0:07:24.4 S1: to

0:07:24.7 S1: teach

0:07:25.3 S1: Timmy

0:07:25.8 S1: Jr.

0:07:26.0 S1: A

0:07:26.2 S1: lesson.

0:07:31.7 S2: So

0:07:32.1 S2: yeah,

0:07:32.3 S2: Timmy's

0:07:32.6 S2: pretty

0:07:32.9 S2: excited

0:07:33.3 S2: about

0:07:33.6 S2: this

0:07:34.0 S2: pet

0:07:34.1 S2: wash/lemonade

0:07:34.3 S2: stand/car

0:07:34.5 S2: wash

0:07:37.6 S2: combination,

0:07:38.4 S2: because

0:07:38.8 S2: as

0:07:39.0 S2: we

0:07:39.2 S2: know,

0:07:39.4 S2: he's

0:07:39.6 S2: very

0:07:39.7 S2: good

0:07:39.9 S2: with

0:07:40.0 S2: the

0:07:40.1 S2: hose.

0:07:41.6 S2: So

0:07:42.6 S2: he

0:07:42.7 S2: comes

0:07:42.9 S2: out

0:07:43.0 S2: of

0:07:43.1 S2: his

0:07:43.3 S2: room

0:07:44.3 S2: and

0:07:46.2 S2: he

0:07:46.4 S2: goes

0:07:46.6 S2: back

0:07:46.8 S2: downstairs,

0:07:47.5 S2: and

0:07:47.8 S2: he's

0:07:48.0 S2: in

0:07:48.0 S2: a

0:07:48.1 S2: much

0:07:48.4 S2: better

0:07:48.9 S2: mood.

0:07:49.2 S2: He

0:07:49.3 S2: apologizes

0:07:50.1 S2: to

0:07:50.3 S2: his

0:07:50.5 S2: whole

0:07:50.8 S2: family.

0:07:52.5 S2: The

0:07:52.7 S2: whole

0:07:52.9 S2: family's...

0:07:53.9 S2: They're

0:07:54.1 S2: pretty

0:07:54.3 S2: good

0:07:54.4 S2: to

0:07:54.5 S2: go

0:07:54.7 S2: now.

0:07:54.9 S2: And

0:07:55.2 S2: Timmy,

0:07:56.1 S2: he

0:07:56.2 S2: starts

0:07:56.5 S2: to

0:07:56.6 S2: lay

0:07:56.8 S2: out

0:07:56.9 S2: his

0:07:57.0 S2: plans

0:07:57.9 S2: to

0:07:58.1 S2: craft

0:07:58.4 S2: this

0:07:58.6 S2: business

0:07:59.2 S2: and

0:07:59.4 S2: get

0:07:59.5 S2: it

0:07:59.6 S2: going.

0:08:00.7 S1: And

0:08:01.5 S1: the

0:08:02.1 S1: other

0:08:02.4 S1: siblings

0:08:02.8 S1: realized

0:08:03.4 S1: that

0:08:04.1 S1: while

0:08:04.4 S1: they're

0:08:06.0 S1: all

0:08:06.0 S1: also

0:08:07.0 S1: in

0:08:07.2 S1: trouble

0:08:07.5 S1: due

0:08:07.7 S1: to

0:08:07.8 S1: this

0:08:08.1 S1: water

0:08:08.4 S1: damage,

0:08:08.9 S1: so

0:08:09.1 S1: they

0:08:09.3 S1: think

0:08:09.5 S1: maybe

0:08:09.8 S1: it

0:08:10.0 S1: would

0:08:10.1 S1: be

0:08:10.2 S1: beneficial

0:08:10.8 S1: for

0:08:10.9 S1: them

0:08:11.1 S1: to

0:08:11.3 S1: chip

0:08:11.5 S1: in

0:08:11.7 S1: as

0:08:11.9 S1: well.

0:08:13.0 S1: And

0:08:13.7 S1: it's

0:08:14.0 S1: been

0:08:14.2 S1: very

0:08:14.6 S1: clear

0:08:14.8 S1: from

0:08:15.0 S1: the

0:08:15.2 S1: start

0:08:15.4 S1: that

0:08:15.6 S1: this

0:08:15.7 S1: is

0:08:15.9 S1: Timmy

0:08:16.4 S1: Jr's

0:08:16.7 S1: project,

0:08:17.3 S1: so

0:08:17.6 S1: the

0:08:17.9 S1: arguing

0:08:18.5 S1: is

0:08:18.7 S1: pretty

0:08:19.0 S1: limited.

0:08:19.9 S1: And

0:08:20.0 S1: the

0:08:20.2 S1: other

0:08:20.5 S1: siblings

0:08:20.9 S1: decided

0:08:21.4 S1: they

0:08:21.7 S1: are

0:08:21.9 S1: gonna

0:08:22.1 S1: help

0:08:22.7 S1: out

0:08:24.2 S1: to

0:08:24.3 S1: restore

0:08:24.7 S1: their

0:08:24.9 S1: house

0:08:25.4 S1: and

0:08:25.7 S1: to

0:08:25.9 S1: help

0:08:26.2 S1: their

0:08:26.3 S1: younger

0:08:26.7 S1: brother.

0:08:30.0 S2: Yeah,

0:08:30.3 S2: so

0:08:31.2 S2: the

0:08:31.3 S2: kids

0:08:31.8 S2: led

0:08:32.0 S2: by

0:08:33.0 S2: Timmy

0:08:33.8 S2: Jr.

0:08:34.4 S2: Start

0:08:35.4 S2: building

0:08:35.8 S2: a

0:08:35.9 S2: lemonade

0:08:36.4 S2: stand.

0:08:37.4 S2: They're

0:08:37.6 S2: going

0:08:37.8 S2: outside,

0:08:38.2 S2: and

0:08:38.4 S2: they're

0:08:38.6 S2: building

0:08:38.8 S2: a

0:08:38.9 S2: lemonade

0:08:39.0 S2: stand.

0:08:39.5 S2: They

0:08:39.7 S2: get

0:08:39.8 S2: that

0:08:40.1 S2: set

0:08:40.3 S2: up,

0:08:41.2 S2: and

0:08:42.4 S2: they

0:08:43.0 S2: get

0:08:43.1 S2: even

0:08:43.4 S2: more

0:08:43.6 S2: hoses

0:08:44.0 S2: so

0:08:44.2 S2: they

0:08:44.4 S2: can

0:08:44.6 S2: wash

0:08:46.4 S2: pets

0:08:46.9 S2: and

0:08:47.2 S2: cars,

0:08:47.8 S2: big

0:08:48.1 S2: hoses,

0:08:48.5 S2: small

0:08:48.8 S2: hoses,

0:08:49.1 S2: all

0:08:49.3 S2: kinds

0:08:49.5 S2: of

0:08:49.6 S2: hoses.

0:08:50.5 S2: And

0:08:51.0 S2: they're

0:08:51.2 S2: putting

0:08:51.5 S2: up

0:08:51.7 S2: flyers

0:08:52.1 S2: around

0:08:52.4 S2: town

0:08:54.8 S2: to

0:08:54.9 S2: get

0:08:55.0 S2: this

0:08:55.2 S2: business

0:08:55.6 S2: going,

0:08:56.1 S2: and

0:08:57.2 S2: now

0:08:57.4 S2: they're

0:08:57.6 S2: open,

0:08:58.0 S2: it's

0:08:58.4 S2: their

0:08:58.9 S2: first

0:08:59.4 S2: day

0:08:59.7 S2: of

0:08:59.9 S2: business.

0:09:00.6 S1: So

0:09:00.9 S1: business

0:09:01.5 S1: opens,

0:09:02.1 S1: and

0:09:02.6 S1: it's

0:09:03.2 S1: pretty

0:09:04.0 S1: slow

0:09:04.5 S1: start

0:09:05.2 S1: mostly

0:09:05.9 S1: 'cause

0:09:06.5 S1: the

0:09:06.6 S1: weather's

0:09:07.0 S1: been

0:09:07.3 S1: good,

0:09:07.6 S1: cars

0:09:07.9 S1: are

0:09:08.0 S1: pretty

0:09:08.3 S1: clean.

0:09:09.8 S1: But

0:09:10.0 S1: eventually,

0:09:10.7 S1: people

0:09:11.0 S1: start

0:09:11.3 S1: noticing

0:09:11.9 S1: that

0:09:12.1 S1: there's

0:09:12.9 S1: a

0:09:13.0 S1: pretty

0:09:13.3 S1: massive

0:09:13.8 S1: operation

0:09:14.4 S1: underway

0:09:14.9 S1: outside

0:09:15.4 S1: of

0:09:15.5 S1: the

0:09:15.6 S1: family

0:09:16.0 S1: home.

0:09:17.3 S1: And

0:09:17.6 S1: slowly

0:09:18.6 S1: but

0:09:19.0 S1: surely,

0:09:19.4 S1: neighbors

0:09:19.9 S1: come

0:09:20.1 S1: by

0:09:20.5 S1: and

0:09:20.6 S1: the

0:09:20.8 S1: neighbors

0:09:21.2 S1: are

0:09:21.7 S1: kinda

0:09:22.4 S1: enjoying

0:09:22.9 S1: the

0:09:23.0 S1: lemonade

0:09:23.6 S1: and

0:09:24.1 S1: then

0:09:24.3 S1: they're

0:09:24.4 S1: bringing

0:09:24.7 S1: their

0:09:24.8 S1: bikes

0:09:25.1 S1: over

0:09:25.5 S1: to

0:09:25.6 S1: get

0:09:25.8 S1: washed,

0:09:26.3 S1: and

0:09:27.3 S1: it's

0:09:27.6 S1: picking

0:09:27.9 S1: up

0:09:28.2 S1: slowly

0:09:29.1 S1: but

0:09:29.3 S1: steadily.

0:09:32.4 S2: So

0:09:33.4 S2: time

0:09:33.7 S2: keeps

0:09:34.0 S2: going

0:09:34.2 S2: by

0:09:34.5 S2: and

0:09:34.9 S2: this

0:09:35.1 S2: lemonade/car

0:09:36.9 S2: wash/pet

0:09:38.0 S2: washing

0:09:38.4 S2: business

0:09:38.7 S2: is

0:09:38.9 S2: really

0:09:39.2 S2: taking

0:09:39.5 S2: off.

0:09:40.4 S2: And

0:09:40.6 S2: it's

0:09:40.8 S2: not

0:09:41.1 S2: soon

0:09:41.6 S2: before

0:09:42.7 S2: Warren

0:09:43.0 S2: Buffett,

0:09:43.5 S2: who

0:09:43.6 S2: I

0:09:43.7 S2: think

0:09:43.9 S2: lives

0:09:44.5 S2: in

0:09:44.8 S2: Omaha,

0:09:45.5 S2: Nebraska,

0:09:46.3 S2: makes

0:09:46.5 S2: his

0:09:46.8 S2: way

0:09:47.0 S2: over

0:09:47.2 S2: to

0:09:47.4 S2: the

0:09:47.6 S2: small

0:09:48.0 S2: town

0:09:49.5 S2: to

0:09:50.8 S2: check

0:09:51.1 S2: out

0:09:51.3 S2: this

0:09:51.5 S2: business

0:09:52.2 S2: with

0:09:52.4 S2: the

0:09:52.5 S2: intention

0:09:53.1 S2: of

0:09:53.9 S2: perhaps

0:09:54.6 S2: offering

0:09:55.1 S2: them

0:09:56.4 S2: money

0:09:56.8 S2: to

0:09:57.4 S2: buy

0:09:57.5 S2: the

0:09:57.7 S2: business,

0:09:58.3 S2: because

0:09:58.6 S2: it's

0:09:58.7 S2: been

0:09:58.9 S2: so

0:09:59.0 S2: successful.

0:10:00.9 S1: And

0:10:01.1 S1: as

0:10:01.3 S1: we

0:10:01.4 S1: all

0:10:01.6 S1: know,

0:10:02.2 S1: Warren

0:10:02.6 S1: Buffett's

0:10:03.2 S1: initial

0:10:03.7 S1: business

0:10:04.3 S1: proposal

0:10:05.0 S1: and

0:10:05.2 S1: plan

0:10:05.6 S1: as

0:10:05.8 S1: a

0:10:05.9 S1: young

0:10:06.1 S1: boy

0:10:07.1 S1: was

0:10:07.6 S1: a

0:10:07.8 S1: combination,

0:10:09.7 S1: beverage

0:10:10.3 S1: station,

0:10:10.8 S1: car

0:10:11.1 S1: wash.

0:10:12.3 S1: So

0:10:12.5 S1: he's

0:10:12.8 S1: really

0:10:13.0 S1: intrigued,

0:10:13.8 S1: and

0:10:14.0 S1: he

0:10:14.1 S1: comes

0:10:14.4 S1: right

0:10:14.6 S1: up

0:10:14.8 S1: to

0:10:14.9 S1: the

0:10:15.0 S1: door

0:10:15.3 S1: and

0:10:15.4 S1: knocks,

0:10:16.5 S1: brings

0:10:16.9 S1: his

0:10:17.2 S1: car,

0:10:17.5 S1: super

0:10:18.2 S1: dirty

0:10:18.7 S1: Tesla,

0:10:19.4 S1: to

0:10:19.6 S1: see

0:10:19.9 S1: if

0:10:20.0 S1: anyone's

0:10:20.5 S1: interested

0:10:21.1 S1: in

0:10:21.5 S1: trying

0:10:21.8 S1: out

0:10:22.0 S1: their

0:10:22.7 S1: skill,

0:10:23.4 S1: and

0:10:23.7 S1: the

0:10:24.0 S1: family

0:10:24.4 S1: opens

0:10:24.7 S1: the

0:10:24.8 S1: door

0:10:25.0 S1: and

0:10:25.1 S1: just

0:10:25.5 S1: can't

0:10:25.8 S1: believe

0:10:26.0 S1: it,

0:10:26.3 S1: because

0:10:26.6 S1: of

0:10:26.7 S1: course,

0:10:27.3 S1: the

0:10:27.6 S1: celebrity

0:10:28.2 S1: from

0:10:28.5 S1: Omaha

0:10:28.9 S1: is

0:10:29.1 S1: on

0:10:29.3 S1: their

0:10:30.1 S1: doorstep.

0:10:31.2 S2: So

0:10:31.6 S2: Warren

0:10:32.5 S2: Buffett's

0:10:33.6 S2: on

0:10:33.8 S2: their

0:10:34.0 S2: doorstep

0:10:35.3 S2: with

0:10:35.5 S2: his

0:10:35.7 S2: Tesla,

0:10:36.4 S2: and

0:10:36.5 S2: out

0:10:36.7 S2: of

0:10:36.8 S2: the

0:10:36.9 S2: back

0:10:38.7 S2: come

0:10:39.5 S2: three

0:10:40.2 S2: dirty

0:10:40.5 S2: dogs,

0:10:41.6 S2: and

0:10:42.6 S2: he's

0:10:42.9 S2: saying,

0:10:43.4 S2: "Hey,

0:10:43.7 S2: Timmy,

0:10:44.6 S2: if

0:10:44.7 S2: you

0:10:44.9 S2: can

0:10:46.2 S2: do

0:10:46.3 S2: a

0:10:46.4 S2: good

0:10:46.6 S2: job

0:10:46.8 S2: washing

0:10:47.2 S2: my

0:10:47.4 S2: car

0:10:47.6 S2: and

0:10:47.8 S2: washing

0:10:48.1 S2: my

0:10:48.3 S2: dogs

0:10:49.3 S2: and

0:10:49.6 S2: fixing

0:10:50.0 S2: me

0:10:50.0 S2: a

0:10:50.2 S2: glass

0:10:50.5 S2: of

0:10:50.6 S2: delicious

0:10:50.9 S2: lemonade,

0:10:51.4 S2: if

0:10:51.5 S2: you

0:10:51.7 S2: can

0:10:51.8 S2: do

0:10:52.0 S2: all

0:10:52.1 S2: that,

0:10:53.1 S2: I'm

0:10:53.3 S2: gonna

0:10:53.8 S2: make

0:10:54.0 S2: you

0:10:54.2 S2: a

0:10:54.4 S2: very,

0:10:54.7 S2: very

0:10:54.9 S2: generous

0:10:55.4 S2: offer

0:10:56.5 S2: on

0:10:56.9 S2: this

0:10:57.1 S2: business

0:10:57.4 S2: that

0:10:57.5 S2: you

0:10:57.7 S2: have

0:10:57.8 S2: going

0:10:58.1 S2: here."

0:10:58.4 S1: And

0:10:59.3 S1: Timmy

0:11:00.6 S1: is

0:11:01.2 S1: nervous.

0:11:02.7 S1: He's

0:11:02.9 S1: pretty

0:11:03.2 S1: nervous

0:11:03.6 S1: by

0:11:03.8 S1: this

0:11:04.0 S1: opportunity,

0:11:04.8 S1: because

0:11:06.0 S1: he

0:11:06.1 S1: wasn't

0:11:06.4 S1: expecting

0:11:07.0 S1: it.

0:11:07.2 S1: But

0:11:08.0 S1: he

0:11:08.3 S1: knows

0:11:08.9 S1: that

0:11:09.3 S1: his

0:11:09.6 S1: family

0:11:10.0 S1: needs

0:11:10.3 S1: the

0:11:10.4 S1: money

0:11:10.7 S1: and

0:11:11.0 S1: he

0:11:11.1 S1: also

0:11:11.5 S1: wants

0:11:11.8 S1: this

0:11:12.1 S1: big

0:11:12.3 S1: break,

0:11:12.7 S1: so

0:11:13.0 S1: he

0:11:13.3 S1: picks

0:11:14.0 S1: the

0:11:14.2 S1: dirtiest

0:11:14.8 S1: dog

0:11:15.1 S1: to

0:11:15.3 S1: start,

0:11:17.8 S1: a

0:11:17.9 S1: Golden

0:11:18.3 S1: Retriever,

0:11:19.0 S1: classic

0:11:19.4 S1: American

0:11:19.9 S1: dog,

0:11:20.8 S1: just

0:11:21.1 S1: covered

0:11:21.5 S1: in

0:11:21.7 S1: mud,

0:11:22.6 S1: and

0:11:22.9 S1: brings

0:11:23.3 S1: him

0:11:24.1 S1: up

0:11:24.3 S1: to

0:11:24.3 S1: the

0:11:24.5 S1: biggest

0:11:24.9 S1: hose,

0:11:25.6 S1: just

0:11:25.8 S1: start

0:11:26.0 S1: rinsing

0:11:26.3 S1: him

0:11:26.4 S1: off.

0:11:29.9 S2: So

0:11:30.1 S2: Timmy

0:11:30.5 S2: starts

0:11:30.9 S2: rinsing

0:11:31.4 S2: the

0:11:31.6 S2: Retriever,

0:11:32.2 S2: everything's

0:11:32.9 S2: going

0:11:33.2 S2: pretty

0:11:33.4 S2: well

0:11:33.7 S2: so

0:11:33.9 S2: far,

0:11:35.5 S2: he's

0:11:35.7 S2: hosing

0:11:36.0 S2: the

0:11:36.2 S2: retriever

0:11:36.6 S2: off,

0:11:36.8 S2: soaping

0:11:37.1 S2: it

0:11:37.3 S2: up,

0:11:37.6 S2: and

0:11:38.8 S2: before

0:11:38.8 S2: you

0:11:38.9 S2: know

0:11:39.0 S2: it,

0:11:39.2 S2: the

0:11:39.4 S2: retriever's

0:11:40.2 S2: clean.

0:11:40.5 S2: And

0:11:40.7 S2: then

0:11:40.9 S2: he

0:11:41.1 S2: starts

0:11:41.4 S2: on

0:11:41.6 S2: the

0:11:41.7 S2: next

0:11:41.9 S2: dog,

0:11:42.3 S2: which

0:11:42.5 S2: is

0:11:43.3 S2: a

0:11:43.4 S2: very

0:11:43.8 S2: dirty

0:11:44.3 S2: and

0:11:44.5 S2: very

0:11:45.5 S2: tiny

0:11:45.9 S2: Shih

0:11:47.1 S2: Tzu.

0:11:48.1 S2: Timmy

0:11:49.3 S2: also

0:11:49.6 S2: has

0:11:49.8 S2: no

0:11:50.0 S2: problem

0:11:50.3 S2: washing

0:11:50.6 S2: that

0:11:50.8 S2: dog.

0:11:51.9 S2: And

0:11:52.7 S2: before

0:11:53.0 S2: you

0:11:53.1 S2: know

0:11:53.3 S2: it,

0:11:53.4 S2: he's

0:11:53.6 S2: done

0:11:53.8 S2: washing

0:11:54.2 S2: the

0:11:54.4 S2: dogs,

0:11:55.4 S2: and

0:11:56.3 S2: he

0:11:56.4 S2: moves

0:11:56.7 S2: on

0:11:57.0 S2: to

0:11:57.3 S2: get

0:11:57.4 S2: a

0:11:57.5 S2: glass

0:11:57.8 S2: of

0:11:58.0 S2: lemonade

0:11:58.9 S2: for

0:11:59.1 S2: Mr.

0:11:59.3 S2: Buffett.

0:12:00.9 S1: Now,

0:12:01.1 S1: previously,

0:12:01.8 S1: the

0:12:02.0 S1: family

0:12:02.3 S1: had

0:12:02.5 S1: been

0:12:02.6 S1: making

0:12:02.9 S1: lemonade

0:12:03.4 S1: with

0:12:03.7 S1: the

0:12:03.9 S1: hose

0:12:04.3 S1: water,

0:12:06.6 S1: just

0:12:06.8 S1: kind

0:12:06.9 S1: of

0:12:07.0 S1: inclusive

0:12:07.6 S1: business

0:12:08.0 S1: model,

0:12:08.3 S1: but

0:12:08.5 S1: they

0:12:08.8 S1: decided

0:12:09.2 S1: that

0:12:09.5 S1: for

0:12:09.7 S1: Warren

0:12:10.0 S1: Buffett,

0:12:10.3 S1: they

0:12:10.5 S1: need

0:12:10.7 S1: to

0:12:10.8 S1: up

0:12:11.0 S1: their

0:12:11.2 S1: game.

0:12:12.2 S1: So

0:12:13.5 S1: they

0:12:13.7 S1: get

0:12:13.9 S1: some

0:12:14.4 S1: real

0:12:14.6 S1: tap

0:12:14.9 S1: water

0:12:15.3 S1: right

0:12:15.5 S1: from

0:12:15.6 S1: the

0:12:15.7 S1: kitchen

0:12:16.1 S1: sink,

0:12:16.4 S1: and

0:12:16.6 S1: mixed

0:12:16.8 S1: up

0:12:17.2 S1: the

0:12:17.3 S1: most

0:12:17.6 S1: delicious

0:12:18.1 S1: batch

0:12:18.4 S1: of

0:12:18.6 S1: lemonade

0:12:19.0 S1: they

0:12:19.2 S1: could

0:12:19.4 S1: have

0:12:19.5 S1: fathomed,

0:12:20.4 S1: with

0:12:20.8 S1: fresh

0:12:21.4 S1: squeezed

0:12:22.2 S1: lemons,

0:12:22.8 S1: real

0:12:23.1 S1: cane

0:12:23.4 S1: sugar,

0:12:24.2 S1: just

0:12:24.7 S1: going

0:12:25.0 S1: all

0:12:25.3 S1: out

0:12:25.8 S1: for

0:12:26.0 S1: this

0:12:27.0 S1: absolute

0:12:27.7 S1: sell

0:12:28.1 S1: of

0:12:28.2 S1: their

0:12:28.4 S1: business

0:12:28.8 S1: model.

0:12:31.5 S2: So

0:12:31.7 S2: they

0:12:31.9 S2: make

0:12:32.0 S2: this

0:12:32.3 S2: awesome

0:12:33.2 S2: artisanal

0:12:33.8 S2: lemonade

0:12:34.6 S2: for

0:12:34.8 S2: Warren

0:12:35.1 S2: Buffet.

0:12:35.4 S2: He

0:12:35.6 S2: tries

0:12:36.0 S2: it,

0:12:36.1 S2: and

0:12:36.2 S2: he

0:12:36.4 S2: just

0:12:36.6 S2: loves

0:12:36.9 S2: it.

0:12:38.0 S2: So

0:12:38.2 S2: he's

0:12:38.3 S2: very,

0:12:38.6 S2: very

0:12:38.8 S2: happy

0:12:39.2 S2: with

0:12:39.7 S2: the

0:12:39.8 S2: way

0:12:39.9 S2: service

0:12:40.3 S2: has

0:12:40.5 S2: gone

0:12:40.7 S2: so

0:12:40.9 S2: far.

0:12:41.8 S2: And

0:12:42.9 S2: now,

0:12:43.2 S2: all

0:12:43.4 S2: Timmy

0:12:43.8 S2: has

0:12:44.0 S2: to

0:12:44.2 S2: do

0:12:45.5 S2: is

0:12:45.8 S2: wash

0:12:46.1 S2: the

0:12:46.3 S2: Tesla.

0:12:47.4 S2: And

0:12:47.6 S2: if

0:12:47.8 S2: he

0:12:47.9 S2: can

0:12:48.0 S2: wash

0:12:48.4 S2: his

0:12:48.5 S2: Tesla

0:12:48.9 S2: and

0:12:49.1 S2: shine

0:12:49.4 S2: these

0:12:49.7 S2: dogs

0:12:49.9 S2: up,

0:12:51.4 S2: he

0:12:51.6 S2: does

0:12:51.8 S2: a

0:12:51.9 S2: good

0:12:52.0 S2: job

0:12:52.2 S2: with

0:12:52.3 S2: that,

0:12:53.9 S2: then

0:12:54.0 S2: he

0:12:54.2 S2: should

0:12:54.4 S2: be

0:12:54.5 S2: in

0:12:54.6 S2: the

0:12:54.8 S2: clear,

0:12:55.0 S2: and

0:12:55.2 S2: he

0:12:55.3 S2: should

0:12:57.0 S2: be

0:12:57.1 S2: setting

0:12:57.4 S2: his

0:12:57.5 S2: family

0:12:57.9 S2: up

0:12:58.1 S2: for

0:12:58.4 S2: success

0:12:59.0 S2: if

0:12:59.2 S2: he

0:12:59.3 S2: can

0:12:59.5 S2: wash

0:13:00.3 S2: the

0:13:00.9 S2: Tesla.

0:13:01.7 S1: So

0:13:01.9 S1: he

0:13:02.0 S1: approaches

0:13:02.5 S1: the

0:13:02.6 S1: Tesla

0:13:02.9 S1: and

0:13:03.1 S1: is

0:13:03.4 S1: a

0:13:03.5 S1: little

0:13:03.8 S1: bit

0:13:04.0 S1: confused

0:13:04.6 S1: just

0:13:04.8 S1: due

0:13:04.9 S1: to

0:13:05.0 S1: the

0:13:05.2 S1: lack

0:13:05.4 S1: of

0:13:05.6 S1: door

0:13:05.9 S1: handles,

0:13:06.5 S1: but

0:13:06.8 S1: he

0:13:07.0 S1: knows

0:13:07.2 S1: he

0:13:07.4 S1: can

0:13:07.5 S1: work

0:13:07.7 S1: around

0:13:08.1 S1: this.

0:13:09.0 S1: So

0:13:09.1 S1: he

0:13:09.3 S1: gets

0:13:09.6 S1: started,

0:13:10.6 S1: just

0:13:11.0 S1: really

0:13:11.3 S1: delicately

0:13:11.9 S1: cleaning,

0:13:12.2 S1: and

0:13:12.3 S1: all

0:13:12.4 S1: of

0:13:12.5 S1: his

0:13:12.7 S1: siblings

0:13:13.2 S1: join

0:13:13.5 S1: in,

0:13:13.7 S1: and

0:13:13.9 S1: they

0:13:14.0 S1: all

0:13:14.4 S1: take

0:13:14.7 S1: a

0:13:14.9 S1: portion

0:13:15.2 S1: of

0:13:15.3 S1: the

0:13:15.5 S1: car

0:13:15.8 S1: to

0:13:15.9 S1: clean

0:13:17.2 S1: to

0:13:17.3 S1: perfection.

0:13:18.5 S1: And

0:13:18.6 S1: they're

0:13:18.8 S1: going

0:13:19.2 S1: slowly

0:13:19.7 S1: but

0:13:19.9 S1: surely,

0:13:20.9 S1: and

0:13:21.1 S1: after

0:13:21.4 S1: six

0:13:21.7 S1: and

0:13:21.8 S1: a

0:13:21.8 S1: half

0:13:22.1 S1: hours,

0:13:22.8 S1: the

0:13:23.0 S1: Tesla

0:13:23.7 S1: is

0:13:24.0 S1: detailed.

0:13:25.0 S1: And

0:13:25.1 S1: Warren

0:13:25.5 S1: comes

0:13:25.8 S1: over

0:13:26.1 S1: to

0:13:26.3 S1: survey

0:13:26.7 S1: the

0:13:26.9 S1: work

0:13:27.1 S1: that

0:13:27.2 S1: has

0:13:27.4 S1: been

0:13:27.6 S1: done

0:13:27.8 S1: by

0:13:28.0 S1: these

0:13:28.4 S1: poor

0:13:28.8 S1: Nebraskan

0:13:29.5 S1: children.

0:13:30.0 S2: So

0:13:30.5 S2: Warren's...

0:13:32.0 S2: He's

0:13:32.8 S2: coming

0:13:33.8 S2: up

0:13:33.9 S2: to

0:13:34.0 S2: the

0:13:34.1 S2: car,

0:13:34.4 S2: and

0:13:34.5 S2: he's

0:13:34.7 S2: looking

0:13:35.0 S2: around

0:13:35.2 S2: the

0:13:35.4 S2: car,

0:13:36.1 S2: and

0:13:37.6 S2: it

0:13:37.8 S2: looks

0:13:38.1 S2: like

0:13:39.5 S2: everything

0:13:39.9 S2: is

0:13:40.1 S2: up

0:13:40.2 S2: to

0:13:40.3 S2: his

0:13:40.5 S2: standards,

0:13:42.2 S2: and

0:13:42.4 S2: he's

0:13:42.8 S2: pretty

0:13:43.0 S2: excited,

0:13:43.4 S2: he's

0:13:43.6 S2: pretty

0:13:43.8 S2: happy

0:13:44.0 S2: about

0:13:44.2 S2: the

0:13:44.3 S2: work

0:13:44.6 S2: they've

0:13:44.8 S2: done,

0:13:45.8 S2: so

0:13:47.4 S2: he

0:13:47.6 S2: pulls

0:13:48.0 S2: little

0:13:48.5 S2: Timmy

0:13:49.0 S2: aside,

0:13:49.3 S2: and

0:13:50.6 S2: he's

0:13:50.8 S2: prepared

0:13:51.5 S2: to

0:13:51.8 S2: make

0:13:51.9 S2: him

0:13:52.1 S2: a

0:13:52.2 S2: very

0:13:52.5 S2: generous

0:13:53.0 S2: offer

0:13:54.8 S2: for

0:13:55.0 S2: the

0:13:55.2 S2: business.

0:13:55.7 S2: He

0:13:55.9 S2: pulls

0:13:56.3 S2: out

0:13:56.6 S2: a

0:13:56.8 S2: checkbook

0:13:57.4 S2: and

0:13:57.8 S2: he

0:13:58.1 S2: starts

0:13:58.5 S2: writing

0:13:59.2 S2: a

0:13:59.3 S2: number

0:13:59.5 S2: on

0:13:59.6 S2: the

0:13:59.7 S2: check.

0:14:01.8 S1: And

0:14:01.9 S1: the

0:14:02.1 S1: number

0:14:02.4 S1: on

0:14:02.5 S1: the

0:14:02.7 S1: check

0:14:03.7 S1: is

0:14:04.0 S1: $34,000,

0:14:05.3 S1: and

0:14:05.8 S1: Timmy

0:14:06.4 S1: can't

0:14:07.1 S1: even

0:14:07.6 S1: believe

0:14:07.9 S1: it.

0:14:09.0 S1: But

0:14:09.2 S1: he's

0:14:09.5 S1: young,

0:14:10.0 S1: and

0:14:10.2 S1: so

0:14:10.5 S1: his

0:14:10.7 S1: sister

0:14:11.1 S1: sees

0:14:11.4 S1: the

0:14:11.5 S1: number

0:14:11.8 S1: on

0:14:11.9 S1: the

0:14:12.0 S1: check

0:14:12.9 S1: and

0:14:13.1 S1: asks

0:14:13.7 S1: for

0:14:13.9 S1: a

0:14:14.0 S1: bigger

0:14:14.3 S1: number.

0:14:15.0 S1: And

0:14:15.2 S1: another

0:14:15.6 S1: sister

0:14:16.0 S1: comes,

0:14:16.4 S1: Stephanie,

0:14:17.1 S1: from

0:14:17.3 S1: earlier,

0:14:17.9 S1: and

0:14:18.2 S1: she

0:14:18.5 S1: asks

0:14:18.7 S1: for

0:14:18.8 S1: a

0:14:18.9 S1: bigger

0:14:19.1 S1: number,

0:14:19.3 S1: and

0:14:19.4 S1: they're

0:14:19.6 S1: all

0:14:20.0 S1: asking

0:14:20.3 S1: for

0:14:20.6 S1: the

0:14:20.7 S1: biggest

0:14:21.1 S1: numbers

0:14:21.9 S1: until

0:14:22.3 S1: finally,

0:14:22.7 S1: Timmy

0:14:23.1 S1: says,

0:14:23.4 S1: "No.

0:14:24.3 S1: This

0:14:24.5 S1: is

0:14:24.7 S1: what

0:14:24.9 S1: he

0:14:25.1 S1: thinks

0:14:25.5 S1: we're

0:14:25.9 S1: worth.

0:14:26.2 S1: He

0:14:26.4 S1: knows

0:14:26.7 S1: the

0:14:26.9 S1: market,

0:14:27.7 S1: $34,000

0:14:28.7 S1: is

0:14:28.9 S1: enough

0:14:29.2 S1: for

0:14:29.4 S1: us."

0:14:32.5 S2: So

0:14:32.7 S2: Warren

0:14:33.2 S2: Buffet

0:14:33.6 S2: overhears

0:14:36.1 S2: the

0:14:36.3 S2: children

0:14:36.9 S2: squabbling,

0:14:37.7 S2: and

0:14:38.6 S2: he

0:14:40.2 S2: takes...

0:14:41.5 S2: It

0:14:41.8 S2: sort

0:14:41.9 S2: of

0:14:42.1 S2: resonates

0:14:42.5 S2: with

0:14:42.7 S2: him,

0:14:43.0 S2: and

0:14:43.5 S2: he

0:14:43.6 S2: says,

0:14:44.0 S2: "You

0:14:44.1 S2: know

0:14:44.3 S2: what,

0:14:45.2 S2: I'm

0:14:45.3 S2: just

0:14:45.4 S2: gonna

0:14:45.7 S2: pack

0:14:45.9 S2: a

0:14:46.0 S2: couple

0:14:46.3 S2: more

0:14:46.5 S2: zeros

0:14:46.9 S2: on

0:14:47.1 S2: there."

0:14:47.9 S2: And

0:14:48.4 S2: he

0:14:48.6 S2: ends

0:14:48.9 S2: up

0:14:49.0 S2: buying

0:14:50.1 S2: the

0:14:50.3 S2: car

0:14:50.6 S2: wash/lemonade/pet

0:14:52.0 S2: store

0:14:52.4 S2: business

0:14:53.0 S2: for

0:14:53.2 S2: $34

0:14:53.9 S2: million,

0:14:55.8 S2: and

0:14:56.5 S2: their

0:14:56.8 S2: dad

0:14:57.0 S2: just

0:14:57.2 S2: is

0:14:57.4 S2: in

0:14:57.5 S2: disbelief.
