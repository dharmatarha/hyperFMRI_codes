0:00:00.9 S1: So

0:00:01.5 S1: one

0:00:01.8 S1: day,

0:00:02.3 S1: in

0:00:02.6 S1: Fort

0:00:03.3 S1: Summer

0:00:04.1 S1: House,

0:00:04.9 S1: a

0:00:05.1 S1: group

0:00:05.8 S1: of

0:00:06.2 S1: blockmates

0:00:07.6 S1: found

0:00:08.3 S1: themselves

0:00:09.7 S1: hanging

0:00:10.5 S1: out

0:00:10.8 S1: in

0:00:11.0 S1: their

0:00:11.2 S1: common

0:00:11.6 S1: room

0:00:12.4 S1: just

0:00:13.5 S1: going

0:00:14.0 S1: on

0:00:14.5 S1: and

0:00:14.7 S1: on

0:00:15.1 S1: about

0:00:15.4 S1: their

0:00:15.8 S1: favorite

0:00:16.6 S1: things

0:00:17.2 S1: about

0:00:17.6 S1: being

0:00:17.9 S1: at

0:00:18.2 S1: the

0:00:18.5 S1: MoHo,

0:00:18.8 S1: one

0:00:19.0 S1: of

0:00:19.2 S1: which

0:00:19.5 S1: was

0:00:19.8 S1: the

0:00:19.9 S1: fact

0:00:20.7 S1: that

0:00:20.8 S1: they

0:00:21.1 S1: had

0:00:21.5 S1: a

0:00:21.6 S1: common

0:00:22.0 S1: room

0:00:22.3 S1: to

0:00:22.4 S1: hang

0:00:23.0 S1: out

0:00:23.5 S1: in.

0:00:23.7 S1: And

0:00:23.8 S1: they

0:00:24.1 S1: were

0:00:24.5 S1: so

0:00:24.8 S1: glad

0:00:25.0 S1: they

0:00:25.2 S1: weren't

0:00:25.6 S1: at

0:00:25.7 S1: Adam's,

0:00:26.2 S1: where

0:00:26.4 S1: there

0:00:26.6 S1: wasn't

0:00:26.9 S1: such

0:00:31.3 S1: a

0:00:31.6 S1: luxury.

0:00:32.4 S2: Another

0:00:32.3 S2: reason

0:00:32.7 S2: these

0:00:33.0 S2: students

0:00:33.4 S2: loved

0:00:33.7 S2: Fort

0:00:33.9 S2: Summer

0:00:34.3 S2: House

0:00:34.6 S2: was

0:00:34.8 S2: because

0:00:35.1 S2: of

0:00:35.3 S2: the

0:00:35.5 S2: amazing

0:00:35.9 S2: outing

0:00:36.2 S2: that

0:00:36.5 S2: the

0:00:36.7 S2: tutors

0:00:37.0 S2: planned.

0:00:37.3 S2: They

0:00:37.5 S2: were

0:00:37.9 S2: all

0:00:38.2 S2: signed

0:00:38.6 S2: up

0:00:39.0 S2: the

0:00:39.2 S2: next

0:00:39.5 S2: day

0:00:39.7 S2: to

0:00:39.9 S2: go

0:00:40.1 S2: on

0:00:40.3 S2: an

0:00:40.5 S2: outing

0:00:41.3 S2: with

0:00:41.8 S2: one

0:00:41.9 S2: of

0:00:42.0 S2: their

0:00:42.4 S2: favorite

0:00:42.9 S2: tutors

0:00:43.7 S2: who

0:00:43.9 S2: was

0:00:44.1 S2: going

0:00:44.4 S2: to

0:00:44.6 S2: take

0:00:44.9 S2: them

0:00:46.0 S2: to

0:00:48.0 S2: a

0:00:48.3 S2: site

0:00:48.6 S2: that

0:00:48.9 S2: was

0:00:49.2 S2: rumored

0:00:49.7 S2: to

0:00:49.9 S2: have

0:00:50.7 S2: magical

0:00:51.2 S2: powers.

0:00:52.6 S2: The

0:00:52.8 S2: students

0:00:53.2 S2: were

0:00:53.4 S2: pretty

0:00:53.7 S2: sure

0:00:53.9 S2: they

0:00:54.1 S2: didn't

0:00:54.4 S2: believe

0:00:54.7 S2: in

0:00:54.9 S2: the

0:00:55.0 S2: magical

0:00:55.7 S2: powers

0:00:56.2 S2: but

0:00:56.3 S2: they

0:00:56.6 S2: loved

0:00:56.9 S2: the

0:00:57.0 S2: trip.

0:01:00.1 S1: So

0:01:00.4 S1: the

0:01:00.7 S1: day

0:01:00.7 S1: comes

0:01:01.2 S1: when

0:01:01.4 S1: they're

0:01:01.6 S1: preparing

0:01:02.1 S1: to

0:01:02.3 S1: go

0:01:02.4 S1: out

0:01:02.5 S1: on

0:01:02.7 S1: the

0:01:02.8 S1: bus

0:01:03.4 S1: and

0:01:03.6 S1: they're

0:01:03.8 S1: all

0:01:04.1 S1: meeting

0:01:04.7 S1: in

0:01:04.9 S1: the

0:01:05.8 S1: main

0:01:06.2 S1: entryway

0:01:08.1 S1: and

0:01:08.3 S1: they're

0:01:08.6 S1: about

0:01:08.9 S1: 12

0:01:09.3 S1: of

0:01:09.4 S1: the

0:01:09.6 S1: students

0:01:10.1 S1: there,

0:01:11.0 S1: and

0:01:11.2 S1: their

0:01:11.8 S1: favorite

0:01:12.7 S1: tutor,

0:01:13.2 S1: who

0:01:13.6 S1: is

0:01:13.9 S1: named

0:01:14.4 S1: Bob,

0:01:16.0 S1: shows

0:01:16.3 S1: up

0:01:16.6 S1: and

0:01:16.8 S1: says,

0:01:17.2 S1: "Come

0:01:17.4 S1: on

0:01:17.8 S1: kids,

0:01:18.8 S1: we're

0:01:19.0 S1: gonna

0:01:19.2 S1: go

0:01:19.6 S1: get

0:01:19.8 S1: in

0:01:20.3 S1: the

0:01:20.4 S1: Lyft

0:01:20.7 S1: that

0:01:20.9 S1: I've

0:01:21.0 S1: ordered."

0:01:22.1 S1: And

0:01:22.2 S1: so

0:01:22.4 S1: all

0:01:22.5 S1: of

0:01:22.7 S1: them

0:01:23.1 S1: go

0:01:23.2 S1: out

0:01:23.5 S1: the

0:01:23.7 S1: front

0:01:24.1 S1: door

0:01:24.3 S1: and

0:01:24.5 S1: wait

0:01:24.7 S1: for

0:01:24.9 S1: the

0:01:25.0 S1: Lyft

0:01:25.4 S1: to

0:01:25.5 S1: arrive.

0:01:30.0 S2: They're

0:01:27.2 S2: waiting

0:01:28.3 S2: and

0:01:28.9 S2: waiting

0:01:30.0 S2: and

0:01:30.6 S2: waiting

0:01:31.7 S2: for

0:01:32.3 S2: the

0:01:32.8 S2: Lyft

0:01:33.4 S2: and

0:01:33.9 S2: it's

0:01:34.2 S2: so

0:01:34.5 S2: unreliable

0:01:35.2 S2: that

0:01:35.4 S2: they

0:01:35.6 S2: decide

0:01:35.9 S2: to

0:01:36.0 S2: switch

0:01:36.3 S2: to

0:01:36.9 S2: Uber

0:01:37.4 S2: instead.

0:01:38.0 S2: They

0:01:38.4 S2: feel

0:01:38.8 S2: grateful

0:01:39.4 S2: to

0:01:39.5 S2: live

0:01:40.9 S2: in

0:01:41.7 S2: such

0:01:42.8 S2: a

0:01:42.9 S2: time

0:01:43.2 S2: when

0:01:43.4 S2: they're

0:01:43.8 S2: able

0:01:44.1 S2: to

0:01:44.3 S2: just

0:01:44.5 S2: conjure

0:01:44.9 S2: up

0:01:45.1 S2: transportation

0:01:45.9 S2: from

0:01:46.1 S2: their

0:01:46.5 S2: smartphones.

0:01:47.1 S2: The

0:01:47.3 S2: Uber

0:01:47.5 S2: arrives

0:01:47.9 S2: and

0:01:48.1 S2: it's

0:01:48.3 S2: a

0:01:48.5 S2: large

0:01:49.1 S2: Uber

0:01:49.8 S2: XL

0:01:50.2 S2: and

0:01:50.7 S2: they

0:01:51.4 S2: pile

0:01:52.1 S2: in,

0:01:52.5 S2: meanwhile

0:01:53.8 S2: giving

0:01:54.8 S2: the

0:01:55.3 S2: Lyft

0:01:56.0 S2: driver

0:01:56.9 S2: very

0:01:57.6 S2: negative

0:01:58.8 S2: reviews.

0:02:00.8 S1: Now

0:01:59.9 S1: they're

0:02:00.1 S1: all

0:02:00.4 S1: squeezed

0:02:00.9 S1: into

0:02:01.2 S1: these

0:02:01.5 S1: Ubers

0:02:02.8 S1: and

0:02:03.6 S1: on

0:02:03.7 S1: the

0:02:03.8 S1: one

0:02:04.0 S1: hand,

0:02:04.2 S1: some

0:02:04.4 S1: of

0:02:04.5 S1: them

0:02:05.0 S1: are

0:02:05.3 S1: feeling

0:02:06.1 S1: a

0:02:06.2 S1: little

0:02:06.9 S1: like

0:02:07.3 S1: it's

0:02:07.8 S1: too

0:02:08.1 S1: close

0:02:08.6 S1: for

0:02:09.0 S1: comfort

0:02:09.8 S1: but

0:02:09.9 S1: some

0:02:10.0 S1: of

0:02:10.0 S1: them

0:02:10.1 S1: are

0:02:10.3 S1: also

0:02:10.7 S1: just

0:02:10.9 S1: deeply

0:02:11.4 S1: thrilled

0:02:12.0 S1: to

0:02:12.2 S1: have

0:02:12.4 S1: friends

0:02:12.7 S1: that

0:02:12.9 S1: they

0:02:13.0 S1: can

0:02:13.2 S1: get

0:02:13.3 S1: so

0:02:13.7 S1: close

0:02:14.0 S1: with.

0:02:15.7 S1: And

0:02:15.9 S1: they're

0:02:16.4 S1: singing

0:02:16.9 S1: story...

0:02:17.2 S1: They're

0:02:17.7 S1: singing

0:02:18.2 S1: songs

0:02:18.5 S1: and

0:02:18.7 S1: telling

0:02:19.0 S1: stories

0:02:19.5 S1: to

0:02:19.6 S1: each

0:02:19.8 S1: other

0:02:20.8 S1: as

0:02:20.9 S1: they're

0:02:21.0 S1: going

0:02:21.4 S1: in

0:02:21.7 S1: this

0:02:22.4 S1: Uber

0:02:23.5 S1: on

0:02:23.7 S1: the

0:02:23.8 S1: way

0:02:24.1 S1: to

0:02:24.2 S1: the

0:02:24.3 S1: magical

0:02:24.6 S1: destination,

0:02:25.4 S1: all

0:02:25.9 S1: full

0:02:26.4 S1: of

0:02:26.6 S1: great

0:02:27.0 S1: anticipation.

0:02:29.2 S2: They

0:02:30.0 S2: arrive

0:02:31.2 S2: at

0:02:31.7 S2: their

0:02:32.0 S2: magical

0:02:34.5 S2: destination,

0:02:35.4 S2: they

0:02:35.8 S2: give

0:02:36.1 S2: their

0:02:36.5 S2: Uber

0:02:36.9 S2: driver

0:02:37.3 S2: five

0:02:37.7 S2: stars

0:02:38.6 S2: and

0:02:38.8 S2: they

0:02:39.0 S2: hope

0:02:39.3 S2: that

0:02:39.6 S2: he

0:02:39.9 S2: returns

0:02:41.5 S2: with

0:02:41.7 S2: five

0:02:42.0 S2: stars

0:02:42.3 S2: of

0:02:42.4 S2: their

0:02:42.5 S2: own

0:02:42.9 S2: 'cause

0:02:43.2 S2: they

0:02:43.4 S2: are

0:02:43.6 S2: all

0:02:43.7 S2: quite

0:02:44.2 S2: concerned

0:02:45.0 S2: about

0:02:45.5 S2: their

0:02:46.0 S2: Uber

0:02:46.4 S2: ratings.

0:02:47.0 S2: And

0:02:47.4 S2: they

0:02:47.9 S2: pile

0:02:48.5 S2: out

0:02:49.0 S2: onto

0:02:49.5 S2: this

0:02:49.7 S2: land

0:02:50.4 S2: and

0:02:50.6 S2: it's

0:02:51.1 S2: definitely

0:02:51.8 S2: not

0:02:52.2 S2: what

0:02:52.5 S2: they

0:02:53.1 S2: expected;

0:02:54.2 S2: they

0:02:54.4 S2: look

0:02:54.7 S2: around

0:02:55.2 S2: and

0:02:55.6 S2: they

0:02:55.7 S2: can't

0:02:55.7 S2: really

0:02:56.6 S2: see

0:02:57.4 S2: anything.

0:03:00.1 S1: They

0:03:00.1 S1: can't

0:03:00.4 S1: see

0:03:00.5 S1: anything

0:03:01.0 S1: 'cause

0:03:01.3 S1: all

0:03:01.5 S1: they

0:03:01.8 S1: see

0:03:02.1 S1: is

0:03:02.3 S1: a

0:03:02.7 S1: giant,

0:03:03.4 S1: ancient

0:03:05.9 S1: forest.

0:03:07.7 S1: And

0:03:07.9 S1: this

0:03:08.1 S1: is

0:03:08.2 S1: the

0:03:08.4 S1: kind

0:03:08.6 S1: of

0:03:08.7 S1: thing

0:03:08.9 S1: that

0:03:09.1 S1: reminds

0:03:09.5 S1: them

0:03:09.8 S1: all

0:03:10.2 S1: of

0:03:10.3 S1: the

0:03:10.5 S1: Forbidden

0:03:11.2 S1: Forest

0:03:11.7 S1: from

0:03:11.9 S1: Hogwarts;

0:03:13.3 S1: the

0:03:13.9 S1: little

0:03:14.9 S1: ancient,

0:03:16.0 S1: wise

0:03:16.3 S1: and

0:03:16.7 S1: trees.

0:03:18.2 S1: There

0:03:18.4 S1: are

0:03:18.5 S1: some

0:03:18.9 S1: squirrels

0:03:19.4 S1: that

0:03:19.6 S1: look

0:03:19.8 S1: like

0:03:20.0 S1: they

0:03:21.0 S1: have

0:03:21.2 S1: beards

0:03:21.7 S1: longer

0:03:22.2 S1: than

0:03:22.5 S1: Gandalf.

0:03:23.4 S1: They're

0:03:24.2 S1: just

0:03:24.8 S1: really

0:03:25.6 S1: feeling

0:03:26.0 S1: lots

0:03:26.3 S1: of

0:03:26.4 S1: things

0:03:26.7 S1: about

0:03:27.0 S1: the

0:03:27.1 S1: forest.

0:03:32.0 S2: They,

0:03:32.4 S2: as

0:03:33.5 S2: a

0:03:33.6 S2: group,

0:03:34.0 S2: are

0:03:34.2 S2: nervous

0:03:34.7 S2: about

0:03:35.0 S2: exploring

0:03:36.0 S2: but

0:03:36.4 S2: their

0:03:37.0 S2: tutor,

0:03:37.6 S2: Bob,

0:03:37.9 S2: has

0:03:38.1 S2: always

0:03:38.4 S2: been

0:03:38.6 S2: adventurous

0:03:40.0 S2: and

0:03:40.3 S2: his

0:03:40.9 S2: adventure

0:03:42.1 S2: and

0:03:42.2 S2: enthusiasm

0:03:43.2 S2: is

0:03:43.4 S2: so

0:03:43.7 S2: contagious

0:03:44.5 S2: that

0:03:44.7 S2: they

0:03:45.2 S2: just

0:03:45.8 S2: can't

0:03:45.8 S2: help

0:03:46.2 S2: but

0:03:46.4 S2: follow

0:03:46.8 S2: him.

0:03:48.3 S2: They

0:03:48.5 S2: start

0:03:48.8 S2: walking

0:03:49.3 S2: towards

0:03:50.6 S2: the

0:03:52.4 S2: tree

0:03:53.0 S2: that

0:03:53.2 S2: looks

0:03:54.1 S2: like

0:03:54.4 S2: it

0:03:54.5 S2: came

0:03:54.7 S2: right

0:03:55.0 S2: out

0:03:55.1 S2: of

0:03:55.3 S2: a

0:03:55.4 S2: Harry

0:03:55.6 S2: Potter

0:03:55.9 S2: film

0:03:56.1 S2: and

0:03:56.3 S2: they

0:03:57.0 S2: get

0:03:57.6 S2: closer

0:03:58.6 S2: to

0:03:59.0 S2: it.

0:04:00.3 S1: They're

0:03:59.5 S1: walking

0:04:00.1 S1: up

0:04:00.3 S1: to

0:04:00.4 S1: this

0:04:00.8 S1: tree

0:04:01.6 S1: when

0:04:01.9 S1: all

0:04:02.1 S1: of

0:04:02.3 S1: a

0:04:02.3 S1: sudden,

0:04:02.8 S1: above

0:04:03.2 S1: them,

0:04:03.7 S1: they

0:04:04.6 S1: hear

0:04:05.6 S1: a

0:04:05.9 S1: loud

0:04:06.9 S1: pop.

0:04:07.7 S1: A

0:04:08.0 S1: pop

0:04:08.6 S1: is

0:04:09.0 S1: a

0:04:09.3 S1: little

0:04:09.7 S1: bit

0:04:10.0 S1: of

0:04:10.2 S1: an

0:04:10.4 S1: understatement;

0:04:12.0 S1: it

0:04:12.1 S1: was

0:04:12.2 S1: more

0:04:12.6 S1: like

0:04:13.3 S1: a

0:04:13.5 S1: deafening

0:04:14.7 S1: explosion.

0:04:15.8 S1: They

0:04:16.0 S1: look

0:04:16.1 S1: into

0:04:16.3 S1: the

0:04:16.8 S1: sky

0:04:17.2 S1: and

0:04:17.4 S1: they

0:04:17.5 S1: see

0:04:17.8 S1: a

0:04:18.0 S1: blinding

0:04:18.9 S1: light

0:04:20.4 S1: that

0:04:21.5 S1: seems

0:04:21.8 S1: to

0:04:21.9 S1: be

0:04:22.1 S1: hurtling

0:04:23.0 S1: right

0:04:23.5 S1: at

0:04:23.8 S1: them.

0:04:24.6 S1: And

0:04:24.7 S1: now

0:04:25.1 S1: all

0:04:25.3 S1: of

0:04:25.4 S1: them

0:04:25.7 S1: start

0:04:26.2 S1: screaming

0:04:27.0 S1: 'cause

0:04:27.2 S1: they're

0:04:27.4 S1: full

0:04:27.7 S1: of

0:04:27.8 S1: panic.

0:04:29.3 S2: They're

0:04:30.6 S2: screaming

0:04:31.5 S2: and

0:04:31.8 S2: running

0:04:32.1 S2: around

0:04:33.1 S2: and

0:04:33.7 S2: furiously

0:04:35.3 S2: opening

0:04:35.7 S2: the

0:04:35.9 S2: Uber

0:04:36.3 S2: app

0:04:36.5 S2: on

0:04:36.6 S2: their

0:04:36.6 S2: smartphone

0:04:36.8 S2: so

0:04:36.8 S2: they

0:04:36.9 S2: can

0:04:36.9 S2: try

0:04:37.0 S2: to

0:04:37.3 S2: get

0:04:38.0 S2: a

0:04:38.3 S2: quick

0:04:39.2 S2: getaway

0:04:40.6 S2: but

0:04:40.9 S2: Bob,

0:04:41.4 S2: their

0:04:41.7 S2: fearless

0:04:43.1 S2: leader

0:04:44.2 S2: Bob,

0:04:44.9 S2: says,

0:04:45.7 S2: "Stop

0:04:46.5 S2: panicking

0:04:48.1 S2: you

0:04:48.7 S2: kids.

0:04:49.5 S2: Trust

0:04:50.5 S2: me.

0:04:50.8 S2: This

0:04:51.0 S2: is

0:04:51.2 S2: why

0:04:51.4 S2: we're

0:04:51.7 S2: here.

0:04:52.1 S2: This

0:04:52.5 S2: is

0:04:52.6 S2: why

0:04:52.8 S2: I've

0:04:53.0 S2: brought

0:04:53.4 S2: you

0:04:53.6 S2: here.

0:04:53.9 S2: This

0:04:55.3 S2: is

0:04:55.5 S2: when

0:04:55.7 S2: the

0:04:55.8 S2: outing

0:04:57.2 S2: begins."

0:04:58.7 S1: And

0:04:59.3 S1: in

0:04:59.5 S1: that

0:04:59.7 S1: moment,

0:05:00.3 S1: they

0:05:01.1 S1: pause,

0:05:02.1 S1: they

0:05:02.9 S1: trust

0:05:03.9 S1: Bob,

0:05:04.4 S1: and

0:05:04.7 S1: are

0:05:06.0 S1: hit

0:05:07.1 S1: by

0:05:07.2 S1: the

0:05:07.4 S1: blinding

0:05:07.9 S1: white

0:05:08.2 S1: orb.

0:05:09.8 S1: A

0:05:09.9 S1: little

0:05:10.4 S1: squirrel

0:05:11.0 S1: just

0:05:11.2 S1: gazes

0:05:11.8 S1: at

0:05:12.0 S1: them

0:05:12.5 S1: trying

0:05:13.1 S1: to

0:05:13.4 S1: figure

0:05:14.1 S1: out

0:05:14.3 S1: what

0:05:14.5 S1: happened

0:05:15.6 S1: because

0:05:15.9 S1: something

0:05:16.3 S1: that

0:05:16.4 S1: was...

0:05:16.8 S1: A

0:05:17.0 S1: moment

0:05:17.2 S1: that

0:05:17.4 S1: was

0:05:17.6 S1: so

0:05:17.9 S1: full

0:05:18.4 S1: of

0:05:18.6 S1: panic

0:05:19.1 S1: has

0:05:19.4 S1: turned

0:05:19.8 S1: into

0:05:20.3 S1: a

0:05:21.3 S1: silent,

0:05:23.6 S1: quiet,

0:05:26.0 S1: slightly

0:05:26.9 S1: eerie

0:05:27.6 S1: situation.

0:05:28.6 S2: So

0:05:28.8 S2: the

0:05:29.0 S2: students

0:05:31.5 S2: are

0:05:32.4 S2: staring,

0:05:32.8 S2: the

0:05:33.0 S2: squirrel

0:05:33.5 S2: is

0:05:33.7 S2: staring

0:05:34.1 S2: at

0:05:34.3 S2: the

0:05:34.5 S2: students,

0:05:35.0 S2: and

0:05:35.2 S2: Bob

0:05:35.4 S2: seems

0:05:35.7 S2: to

0:05:35.9 S2: have

0:05:36.1 S2: this

0:05:36.2 S2: look

0:05:36.3 S2: of

0:05:36.4 S2: anticipation

0:05:36.8 S2: on

0:05:36.9 S2: his

0:05:37.0 S2: face,

0:05:37.1 S2: hopeful

0:05:37.4 S2: anticipation.

0:05:37.7 S2: The

0:05:37.9 S2: light

0:05:38.8 S2: becomes

0:05:40.0 S2: less

0:05:40.8 S2: intense

0:05:41.9 S2: to

0:05:42.2 S2: stare

0:05:44.4 S2: at

0:05:45.5 S2: and

0:05:46.9 S2: the

0:05:48.4 S2: students

0:05:51.3 S2: realize

0:05:52.5 S2: that

0:05:52.8 S2: it's

0:05:53.4 S2: a

0:05:53.6 S2: ship

0:05:54.2 S2: that

0:05:54.8 S2: was

0:05:55.3 S2: touching

0:05:56.4 S2: down

0:05:56.9 S2: right

0:05:57.1 S2: where

0:05:57.2 S2: they're

0:05:57.5 S2: standing.

0:06:00.2 S1: It's

0:05:59.9 S1: this

0:06:00.3 S1: beautiful,

0:06:01.4 S1: reflective,

0:06:02.2 S1: mirror-

0:06:03.3 S1: cural

0:06:04.1 S1: ship

0:06:05.0 S1: that

0:06:05.2 S1: even

0:06:05.4 S1: though

0:06:05.5 S1: it

0:06:05.7 S1: looks

0:06:06.1 S1: like

0:06:06.4 S1: it

0:06:07.5 S1: plowed

0:06:08.1 S1: straight

0:06:08.5 S1: into

0:06:08.8 S1: the

0:06:08.9 S1: earth,

0:06:10.0 S1: has

0:06:10.4 S1: somehow

0:06:11.1 S1: positioned

0:06:11.7 S1: itself

0:06:12.8 S1: so

0:06:12.9 S1: its

0:06:13.1 S1: upright.

0:06:15.3 S1: And

0:06:15.5 S1: even

0:06:15.7 S1: though

0:06:15.9 S1: they

0:06:16.1 S1: don't

0:06:16.5 S1: see

0:06:16.6 S1: a

0:06:16.7 S1: door

0:06:17.1 S1: at

0:06:17.4 S1: first,

0:06:17.8 S1: there's

0:06:18.1 S1: a

0:06:18.3 S1: faint

0:06:18.7 S1: outline

0:06:19.8 S1: that

0:06:20.2 S1: slowly

0:06:20.8 S1: darkens

0:06:21.5 S1: and

0:06:21.8 S1: opens

0:06:22.3 S1: from

0:06:22.7 S1: the

0:06:22.9 S1: right

0:06:23.2 S1: to

0:06:23.4 S1: the

0:06:23.6 S1: left

0:06:25.0 S1: and

0:06:25.2 S1: out

0:06:26.0 S1: walks...

0:06:27.2 S2: Out

0:06:28.0 S2: walks

0:06:29.3 S2: what

0:06:30.1 S2: can

0:06:31.6 S2: only

0:06:32.2 S2: be

0:06:32.4 S2: described

0:06:34.2 S2: as

0:06:34.8 S2: an

0:06:35.3 S2: alien.

0:06:36.2 S2: It's

0:06:36.4 S2: an

0:06:36.6 S2: alien

0:06:37.2 S2: that

0:06:37.4 S2: you

0:06:37.5 S2: would

0:06:38.5 S2: think

0:06:38.9 S2: of

0:06:39.1 S2: when

0:06:39.3 S2: someone

0:06:39.7 S2: says,

0:06:40.0 S2: "Think

0:06:40.4 S2: of

0:06:40.5 S2: an

0:06:40.6 S2: alien."

0:06:41.2 S2: The

0:06:41.6 S2: students

0:06:42.4 S2: couldn't

0:06:43.3 S2: believe

0:06:44.0 S2: how

0:06:44.4 S2: prototypical

0:06:45.6 S2: it

0:06:45.9 S2: looked

0:06:46.6 S2: and

0:06:46.9 S2: now

0:06:47.2 S2: it

0:06:47.4 S2: was

0:06:47.6 S2: there

0:06:48.4 S2: in

0:06:48.6 S2: front

0:06:48.9 S2: of

0:06:49.0 S2: them,

0:06:50.2 S2: and

0:06:50.6 S2: they

0:06:51.3 S2: started

0:06:52.3 S2: to

0:06:52.7 S2: wonder

0:06:53.6 S2: what

0:06:54.2 S2: does

0:06:54.9 S2: Bob

0:06:55.4 S2: have

0:06:56.0 S2: in

0:06:56.4 S2: mind

0:06:57.1 S2: for

0:06:57.6 S2: this

0:06:58.2 S2: house

0:06:59.0 S2: outing.

0:07:00.8 S2: And

0:07:00.0 S2: the

0:07:00.2 S2: alien

0:07:00.9 S2: slowly

0:07:02.4 S2: descended

0:07:04.2 S2: from

0:07:04.5 S2: the

0:07:05.3 S2: ship,

0:07:07.8 S2: and

0:07:08.0 S2: the

0:07:08.2 S2: students

0:07:09.6 S2: stared

0:07:10.6 S2: in

0:07:11.0 S2: awe

0:07:11.5 S2: as

0:07:11.7 S2: the

0:07:11.8 S2: alien

0:07:12.3 S2: walked

0:07:12.8 S2: over

0:07:13.2 S2: to

0:07:13.3 S2: Bob,

0:07:15.1 S2: some

0:07:15.2 S2: of

0:07:15.4 S2: them

0:07:15.5 S2: were

0:07:15.9 S2: very

0:07:16.3 S2: concerned

0:07:17.1 S2: as

0:07:17.3 S2: they

0:07:17.5 S2: got

0:07:17.7 S2: closer,

0:07:18.4 S2: one

0:07:18.8 S2: step,

0:07:19.3 S2: the

0:07:19.6 S2: next

0:07:20.0 S2: step,

0:07:20.3 S2: the

0:07:20.6 S2: next

0:07:20.9 S2: step,

0:07:21.9 S2: until

0:07:22.2 S2: it

0:07:22.4 S2: reached

0:07:22.8 S2: out

0:07:23.0 S2: its

0:07:23.2 S2: arm

0:07:24.0 S2: and

0:07:24.3 S2: gave

0:07:24.6 S2: Bob

0:07:25.1 S2: a

0:07:25.3 S2: high

0:07:25.7 S2: five.

0:07:26.2 S1: The

0:07:27.3 S1: students

0:07:28.7 S1: were

0:07:29.5 S1: shocked,

0:07:30.7 S1: they

0:07:31.4 S1: figured,

0:07:32.6 S1: if

0:07:33.0 S1: an

0:07:33.1 S1: alien

0:07:33.5 S1: was

0:07:33.8 S1: gonna

0:07:34.2 S1: greet

0:07:34.6 S1: someone

0:07:35.2 S1: surely

0:07:35.6 S1: it

0:07:35.8 S1: would

0:07:36.2 S1: go

0:07:36.5 S1: with

0:07:36.8 S1: a

0:07:36.9 S1: proper

0:07:37.4 S1: handshake

0:07:38.1 S1: but

0:07:38.3 S1: this

0:07:38.6 S1: alien

0:07:39.8 S1: seemed

0:07:41.0 S1: to

0:07:41.2 S1: be

0:07:41.3 S1: comfortable

0:07:42.0 S1: with

0:07:42.2 S1: Bob

0:07:42.4 S1: and

0:07:42.6 S1: Bob,

0:07:43.1 S1: likewise,

0:07:43.7 S1: seemed

0:07:43.9 S1: to

0:07:44.1 S1: be

0:07:44.2 S1: comfortable

0:07:44.7 S1: with

0:07:44.9 S1: the

0:07:45.0 S1: alien.

0:07:46.2 S1: They

0:07:46.4 S1: gave

0:07:46.6 S1: each

0:07:46.8 S1: other

0:07:47.6 S1: a

0:07:47.7 S1: high

0:07:48.0 S1: five

0:07:48.9 S1: and

0:07:49.0 S1: then

0:07:49.3 S1: they

0:07:49.4 S1: embraced

0:07:50.0 S1: each

0:07:50.2 S1: other

0:07:50.9 S1: just

0:07:51.2 S1: like

0:07:51.6 S1: Bob

0:07:51.9 S1: would

0:07:52.4 S1: do

0:07:52.6 S1: with

0:07:52.8 S1: one

0:07:52.9 S1: of

0:07:53.1 S1: his

0:07:53.7 S1: close

0:07:54.1 S1: friends.

0:07:54.7 S1: The

0:07:55.0 S1: students

0:07:55.7 S1: were

0:07:56.0 S1: very

0:07:56.5 S1: very

0:07:56.9 S1: confused.

0:08:00.0 S2: And

0:07:59.2 S2: that's

0:07:59.6 S2: when

0:08:00.6 S2: Bob

0:08:01.9 S2: changed.

0:08:04.0 S2: His

0:08:04.4 S2: skin

0:08:05.0 S2: lost

0:08:05.6 S2: its

0:08:06.3 S2: typical

0:08:07.0 S2: brown

0:08:07.6 S2: hue

0:08:09.1 S2: and

0:08:09.3 S2: instead

0:08:09.9 S2: transformed

0:08:11.5 S2: to

0:08:11.7 S2: the

0:08:11.9 S2: prototypical

0:08:12.8 S2: green

0:08:13.2 S2: that

0:08:13.4 S2: they

0:08:13.6 S2: saw

0:08:14.0 S2: in

0:08:14.1 S2: the

0:08:14.7 S2: alien.

0:08:15.2 S2: Needless

0:08:15.9 S2: to

0:08:16.1 S2: say

0:08:16.4 S2: the

0:08:16.6 S2: students

0:08:17.2 S2: were

0:08:17.5 S2: very

0:08:17.8 S2: surprised,

0:08:19.3 S2: except

0:08:19.7 S2: for

0:08:20.0 S2: one,

0:08:20.4 S2: little

0:08:21.4 S2: Tracy

0:08:22.0 S2: who

0:08:22.4 S2: had

0:08:22.7 S2: somehow

0:08:23.5 S2: suspected

0:08:24.4 S2: Bob

0:08:24.7 S2: was

0:08:24.8 S2: an

0:08:25.0 S2: alien

0:08:25.4 S2: all

0:08:25.6 S2: along.

0:08:26.1 S1: Tracy

0:08:27.3 S1: was

0:08:28.1 S1: relieved,

0:08:29.8 S1: she

0:08:30.4 S1: felt

0:08:30.7 S1: like

0:08:30.9 S1: the

0:08:31.0 S1: insane

0:08:31.6 S1: girl

0:08:32.0 S1: that

0:08:32.3 S1: thinks

0:08:32.8 S1: her

0:08:33.0 S1: friends

0:08:33.5 S1: are

0:08:33.9 S1: aliens

0:08:34.4 S1: and

0:08:34.7 S1: now

0:08:35.3 S1: she

0:08:35.5 S1: felt

0:08:35.9 S1: validation

0:08:36.7 S1: that

0:08:37.0 S1: her

0:08:37.3 S1: suspicions

0:08:38.1 S1: had

0:08:38.4 S1: been

0:08:38.8 S1: correct.

0:08:39.3 S1: Nothing

0:08:41.1 S1: feels

0:08:41.5 S1: better

0:08:43.8 S1: than

0:08:45.8 S1: to

0:08:46.0 S1: feel

0:08:46.1 S1: validated.

0:08:46.4 S1: Other

0:08:46.5 S1: students

0:08:46.8 S1: started

0:08:47.0 S1: to

0:08:47.1 S1: wonder,

0:08:47.2 S1: did

0:08:47.2 S1: their

0:08:47.3 S1: house

0:08:47.5 S1: masters

0:08:48.3 S1: know

0:08:48.7 S1: that

0:08:48.9 S1: Bob

0:08:48.9 S1: was

0:08:48.9 S1: an

0:08:48.9 S1: alien

0:08:48.9 S1: before

0:08:48.9 S1: they

0:08:48.9 S1: hired

0:08:48.9 S1: him

0:08:48.9 S1: as

0:08:48.9 S1: a

0:08:49.1 S1: tutor?

0:08:49.1 S1: Was

0:08:50.5 S1: this

0:08:52.5 S1: a

0:08:52.6 S1: way

0:08:52.9 S1: to

0:08:53.2 S1: increase

0:08:53.9 S1: diversity

0:08:54.7 S1: within

0:08:55.0 S1: our

0:08:55.2 S1: house?

0:08:58.5 S2: And

0:08:58.8 S2: other

0:08:59.3 S2: students

0:09:00.0 S2: were

0:09:00.3 S2: still

0:09:01.0 S2: very

0:09:01.6 S2: concerned,

0:09:02.5 S2: in

0:09:02.7 S2: fact,

0:09:03.6 S2: one

0:09:03.7 S2: of

0:09:03.9 S2: them,

0:09:05.5 S2: Larry,

0:09:06.8 S2: could

0:09:07.3 S2: not

0:09:08.2 S2: stop

0:09:08.6 S2: screaming,

0:09:10.6 S2: he

0:09:10.7 S2: was

0:09:11.0 S2: so

0:09:11.2 S2: horrified

0:09:12.0 S2: by

0:09:12.1 S2: what

0:09:12.3 S2: he

0:09:12.5 S2: saw

0:09:12.8 S2: in

0:09:13.0 S2: front

0:09:13.2 S2: of

0:09:13.4 S2: him.

0:09:14.6 S2: Now

0:09:14.8 S2: little

0:09:15.1 S2: Tracy

0:09:15.9 S2: tried

0:09:16.2 S2: to

0:09:16.4 S2: turn

0:09:16.7 S2: to

0:09:16.9 S2: Larry

0:09:17.7 S2: and

0:09:18.0 S2: console

0:09:18.6 S2: him,

0:09:19.6 S2: but

0:09:19.8 S2: he

0:09:20.0 S2: would

0:09:20.2 S2: have

0:09:21.0 S2: none

0:09:21.2 S2: of

0:09:21.4 S2: it.

0:09:22.6 S2: In

0:09:22.9 S2: fact,

0:09:23.5 S2: he

0:09:23.7 S2: was

0:09:24.0 S2: tempted

0:09:24.4 S2: to

0:09:24.7 S2: run

0:09:25.1 S2: away

0:09:25.5 S2: from

0:09:25.6 S2: the

0:09:25.8 S2: group,

0:09:26.7 S2: deeper

0:09:27.1 S2: into

0:09:27.4 S2: the

0:09:27.5 S2: woods.

0:09:31.1 S1: Bob

0:09:31.5 S1: realizes

0:09:32.9 S1: he

0:09:34.1 S1: has

0:09:35.3 S1: to

0:09:35.6 S1: address

0:09:35.7 S1: the

0:09:35.8 S1: students.

0:09:35.9 S1: Larry

0:09:36.0 S1: won't

0:09:36.0 S1: stop

0:09:36.1 S1: screaming

0:09:36.2 S1: and

0:09:36.4 S1: it's

0:09:36.6 S1: starting

0:09:37.0 S1: to

0:09:37.1 S1: become

0:09:37.4 S1: a

0:09:37.5 S1: real

0:09:37.9 S1: problem.

0:09:39.2 S1: Bob

0:09:39.9 S1: faces

0:09:40.8 S1: the

0:09:40.8 S1: students,

0:09:41.5 S1: with

0:09:41.8 S1: his

0:09:41.9 S1: alien

0:09:42.5 S1: friend

0:09:43.5 S1: and

0:09:43.7 S1: raises

0:09:44.3 S1: his

0:09:44.7 S1: hand,

0:09:45.1 S1: Larry

0:09:45.6 S1: stopped

0:09:46.2 S1: screaming

0:09:47.1 S1: in

0:09:47.3 S1: response.

0:09:47.9 S1: Bob

0:09:49.4 S1: explains,

0:09:52.5 S1: "The

0:09:52.7 S1: reason

0:09:53.1 S1: why

0:09:53.5 S1: I've

0:09:54.0 S1: brought

0:09:54.7 S1: you

0:09:55.1 S1: here

0:09:55.5 S1: is

0:09:56.3 S1: the

0:09:56.6 S1: following...

0:10:00.0 S2: I

0:09:59.2 S2: love

0:09:59.5 S2: you

0:10:01.9 S2: and

0:10:02.1 S2: I

0:10:02.2 S2: wanted

0:10:02.5 S2: you

0:10:02.7 S2: to

0:10:02.8 S2: know

0:10:03.0 S2: the

0:10:03.2 S2: truth,

0:10:05.2 S2: and

0:10:05.4 S2: you

0:10:05.6 S2: couldn't

0:10:05.9 S2: know

0:10:06.1 S2: the

0:10:06.3 S2: truth

0:10:08.3 S2: unless

0:10:08.8 S2: I

0:10:09.0 S2: showed

0:10:09.5 S2: my

0:10:09.7 S2: true

0:10:10.0 S2: colors.

0:10:12.5 S2: I've

0:10:12.8 S2: come

0:10:13.1 S2: to

0:10:13.3 S2: Earth

0:10:14.5 S2: in

0:10:14.7 S2: order

0:10:15.1 S2: to

0:10:15.3 S2: help

0:10:16.5 S2: young

0:10:17.9 S2: humans

0:10:20.6 S2: discover

0:10:21.5 S2: true

0:10:22.1 S2: empathy

0:10:23.5 S2: for,

0:10:23.9 S2: not

0:10:24.1 S2: only

0:10:24.3 S2: themselves,

0:10:25.8 S2: but

0:10:26.0 S2: all

0:10:26.2 S2: creatures

0:10:26.6 S2: throughout

0:10:27.5 S2: the

0:10:27.8 S2: universe."

0:10:28.5 S1: The

0:10:28.8 S1: students

0:10:29.5 S1: were

0:10:29.9 S1: inspired

0:10:30.6 S1: by

0:10:30.8 S1: the

0:10:31.1 S1: show

0:10:31.5 S1: of

0:10:31.7 S1: affection

0:10:32.4 S1: and

0:10:32.6 S1: the

0:10:32.8 S1: show

0:10:32.9 S1: of

0:10:33.1 S1: honesty,

0:10:34.7 S1: they

0:10:34.9 S1: decided

0:10:35.3 S1: that

0:10:35.6 S1: they

0:10:35.8 S1: wanted

0:10:36.2 S1: to

0:10:36.3 S1: show

0:10:36.6 S1: their

0:10:36.9 S1: true

0:10:37.2 S1: colors

0:10:37.5 S1: as

0:10:37.8 S1: well.

0:10:38.2 S1: The

0:10:38.5 S1: students

0:10:39.2 S1: were

0:10:39.6 S1: all

0:10:39.9 S1: humans,

0:10:40.5 S1: don't

0:10:40.9 S1: get

0:10:41.2 S1: me

0:10:41.3 S1: wrong,

0:10:42.2 S1: but

0:10:42.4 S1: they

0:10:42.6 S1: all

0:10:42.9 S1: carried

0:10:43.7 S1: secrets.

0:10:44.5 S1: Secrets

0:10:45.4 S1: of

0:10:45.7 S1: self-

0:10:46.2 S1: doubt,

0:10:46.8 S1: fears

0:10:47.4 S1: of

0:10:47.7 S1: the

0:10:48.1 S1: future,

0:10:48.8 S1: family

0:10:49.5 S1: issues,

0:10:52.5 S1: they

0:10:52.7 S1: laid

0:10:52.9 S1: it

0:10:53.0 S1: all

0:10:53.3 S1: out

0:10:53.5 S1: there.

0:10:55.7 S1: They

0:10:56.0 S1: showed

0:10:56.3 S1: their

0:10:56.8 S1: true

0:10:57.2 S1: colors.

0:11:00.5 S2: Now

0:11:00.7 S2: this

0:11:01.0 S2: process

0:11:01.6 S2: went

0:11:01.8 S2: on

0:11:02.1 S2: for

0:11:02.3 S2: quite

0:11:02.7 S2: some

0:11:03.0 S2: time,

0:11:03.4 S2: and

0:11:03.7 S2: thank

0:11:04.0 S2: goodness,

0:11:04.7 S2: Larry

0:11:05.3 S2: stopped

0:11:05.7 S2: screaming

0:11:06.5 S2: about

0:11:07.1 S2: an

0:11:07.3 S2: hour

0:11:07.7 S2: in,

0:11:08.2 S2: so

0:11:08.4 S2: that

0:11:08.6 S2: was

0:11:08.8 S2: good.

0:11:09.1 S2: People

0:11:09.3 S2: were

0:11:09.5 S2: relieved

0:11:10.0 S2: by

0:11:10.2 S2: that,

0:11:11.5 S2: but

0:11:11.8 S2: needless

0:11:12.2 S2: to

0:11:12.4 S2: say,

0:11:13.3 S2: they

0:11:13.5 S2: created

0:11:14.1 S2: a

0:11:14.6 S2: campfire

0:11:16.7 S2: and

0:11:16.8 S2: they

0:11:17.0 S2: had

0:11:17.3 S2: many

0:11:18.3 S2: s'mores

0:11:20.0 S2: and

0:11:20.8 S2: they

0:11:21.1 S2: had

0:11:21.4 S2: an

0:11:21.8 S2: incredible

0:11:22.5 S2: evening

0:11:23.2 S2: talking

0:11:23.6 S2: about

0:11:23.9 S2: all

0:11:24.4 S2: of

0:11:24.5 S2: their

0:11:24.8 S2: hidden

0:11:25.4 S2: secrets.

0:11:29.9 S1: Now

0:11:30.1 S1: that

0:11:30.4 S1: the

0:11:30.8 S1: purpose

0:11:31.1 S1: of

0:11:31.2 S1: the

0:11:31.3 S1: outing

0:11:31.4 S1: had

0:11:31.4 S1: been

0:11:31.5 S1: achieved,

0:11:31.6 S1: Bob

0:11:31.7 S1: has

0:11:31.8 S1: to

0:11:31.8 S1: make

0:11:31.9 S1: a

0:11:32.1 S1: choice.

0:11:35.0 S1: Bob

0:11:36.6 S1: has

0:11:38.2 S1: to

0:11:39.0 S1: decide

0:11:39.5 S1: whether

0:11:39.8 S1: to

0:11:39.9 S1: go

0:11:40.1 S1: back

0:11:40.6 S1: with

0:11:41.1 S1: his

0:11:41.4 S1: alien

0:11:42.0 S1: friend

0:11:42.7 S1: to

0:11:42.9 S1: his

0:11:43.3 S1: alien

0:11:43.9 S1: home

0:11:44.2 S1: or

0:11:44.4 S1: whether

0:11:44.7 S1: to

0:11:45.0 S1: continue

0:11:45.8 S1: influencing

0:11:46.9 S1: the

0:11:47.2 S1: lives

0:11:47.8 S1: of

0:11:48.1 S1: students

0:11:48.9 S1: in

0:11:49.1 S1: Fort

0:11:49.6 S1: Summer

0:11:50.2 S1: House.

0:11:50.8 S1: He

0:11:51.1 S1: was

0:11:51.4 S1: torn,

0:11:51.8 S1: he

0:11:52.0 S1: left

0:11:52.2 S1: his

0:11:52.4 S1: home

0:11:52.6 S1: and

0:11:52.8 S1: he

0:11:53.4 S1: misses

0:11:53.6 S1: it

0:11:53.7 S1: and

0:11:53.8 S1: he

0:11:53.9 S1: hadn't

0:11:54.1 S1: been

0:11:54.2 S1: there

0:11:54.4 S1: in

0:11:54.5 S1: a

0:11:54.6 S1: long

0:11:54.9 S1: time,

0:11:55.8 S1: but

0:11:56.0 S1: he

0:11:56.2 S1: loved

0:11:56.4 S1: his

0:11:56.6 S1: new

0:11:56.8 S1: house

0:11:57.2 S1: as

0:11:57.4 S1: well.

0:12:00.7 S2: Bob

0:11:58.5 S2: was

0:11:59.2 S2: stuck

0:12:00.3 S2: in

0:12:00.9 S2: a

0:12:01.3 S2: real

0:12:02.2 S2: conundrum,

0:12:03.9 S2: he

0:12:04.1 S2: felt

0:12:04.4 S2: affection

0:12:05.5 S2: for

0:12:05.8 S2: people

0:12:06.3 S2: across

0:12:06.8 S2: such

0:12:07.0 S2: a

0:12:07.1 S2: large

0:12:07.5 S2: divide,

0:12:09.5 S2: and

0:12:09.6 S2: what

0:12:09.8 S2: was

0:12:10.1 S2: really

0:12:10.4 S2: touching

0:12:11.3 S2: was

0:12:11.5 S2: that,

0:12:11.8 S2: not

0:12:12.0 S2: only

0:12:12.3 S2: Bob's

0:12:12.7 S2: alien

0:12:13.1 S2: friends,

0:12:13.8 S2: but

0:12:14.0 S2: the

0:12:14.2 S2: students

0:12:14.4 S2: themselves

0:12:15.4 S2: could

0:12:15.6 S2: observe

0:12:16.1 S2: the

0:12:16.3 S2: struggle

0:12:18.1 S2: that

0:12:18.3 S2: Bob

0:12:18.9 S2: was

0:12:19.3 S2: experiencing.

0:12:20.8 S2: So

0:12:21.1 S2: they

0:12:21.2 S2: went

0:12:21.4 S2: up

0:12:21.5 S2: to

0:12:23.3 S2: Bob

0:12:23.7 S2: the

0:12:23.8 S2: alien

0:12:23.9 S2: and

0:12:24.0 S2: they

0:12:24.1 S2: said,

0:12:24.2 S2: "Bob,

0:12:24.2 S2: how

0:12:24.4 S2: can

0:12:24.6 S2: we

0:12:24.7 S2: help

0:12:25.0 S2: you?

0:12:25.9 S2: How

0:12:26.1 S2: can

0:12:26.3 S2: we

0:12:26.4 S2: help

0:12:26.6 S2: you

0:12:26.7 S2: figure

0:12:27.0 S2: this

0:12:27.2 S2: out?"

0:12:30.5 S1: And

0:12:32.0 S1: Bob

0:12:32.4 S1: said

0:12:32.9 S1: to

0:12:33.2 S1: them,

0:12:33.7 S1: "You

0:12:34.0 S1: need

0:12:34.2 S1: to

0:12:34.4 S1: do

0:12:34.7 S1: to

0:12:35.1 S1: others

0:12:35.8 S1: what

0:12:37.2 S1: I've

0:12:38.0 S1: done

0:12:38.9 S1: to

0:12:39.2 S1: you.

0:12:40.3 S1: You

0:12:40.4 S1: can

0:12:40.6 S1: be

0:12:41.3 S1: aliens

0:12:44.3 S1: and

0:12:44.7 S1: you

0:12:45.0 S1: can

0:12:45.8 S1: continue

0:12:46.0 S1: to

0:12:46.1 S1: bring

0:12:46.3 S1: groups

0:12:46.4 S1: of

0:12:46.5 S1: students

0:12:46.7 S1: together,

0:12:46.9 S1: convince

0:12:47.1 S1: them

0:12:47.3 S1: of

0:12:47.3 S1: the

0:12:51.2 S1: power

0:12:51.8 S1: of

0:12:52.1 S1: showing

0:12:52.7 S1: your

0:12:53.0 S1: true

0:12:53.3 S1: colors

0:12:54.3 S1: and

0:12:54.7 S1: see

0:12:56.1 S1: this

0:12:57.8 S1: forward."

0:13:00.2 S2: It

0:13:00.3 S2: goes

0:13:00.5 S2: without

0:13:00.9 S2: saying

0:13:01.3 S2: that

0:13:01.6 S2: the

0:13:01.8 S2: students

0:13:02.2 S2: were

0:13:02.4 S2: overcome

0:13:03.0 S2: with

0:13:03.2 S2: emotion,

0:13:04.2 S2: not

0:13:04.3 S2: only

0:13:04.6 S2: when

0:13:04.7 S2: they

0:13:04.9 S2: realized

0:13:05.6 S2: Bob's

0:13:06.3 S2: deep

0:13:06.8 S2: respect

0:13:07.6 S2: for

0:13:07.8 S2: them,

0:13:09.8 S2: but

0:13:10.0 S2: also

0:13:10.3 S2: when

0:13:10.5 S2: they

0:13:10.6 S2: recognized

0:13:11.3 S2: that

0:13:11.5 S2: Bob

0:13:11.9 S2: was

0:13:13.0 S2: leaving.

0:13:15.3 S2: Larry

0:13:16.8 S2: was

0:13:17.0 S2: also

0:13:17.4 S2: confused

0:13:18.6 S2: how

0:13:18.8 S2: Bob

0:13:19.1 S2: was

0:13:19.7 S2: going

0:13:20.0 S2: to

0:13:20.2 S2: give

0:13:20.4 S2: up

0:13:20.7 S2: a

0:13:20.9 S2: prestigious

0:13:21.5 S2: Harvard

0:13:22.0 S2: PhD,

0:13:23.2 S2: just

0:13:23.5 S2: like

0:13:23.8 S2: that,

0:13:24.6 S2: but

0:13:24.8 S2: Tracy

0:13:25.2 S2: understood

0:13:25.8 S2: that

0:13:25.9 S2: advancing

0:13:26.4 S2: intergalactic

0:13:27.2 S2: empathy

0:13:27.6 S2: was

0:13:27.7 S2: a

0:13:27.8 S2: better

0:13:28.1 S2: goal.

0:13:31.9 S1: And

0:13:32.0 S1: a

0:13:32.2 S1: Harvard

0:13:32.9 S1: PhD

0:13:33.2 S1: didn't

0:13:33.7 S1: mean

0:13:33.8 S1: anything

0:13:35.0 S1: outside

0:13:35.4 S1: of

0:13:35.6 S1: earth's

0:13:36.1 S1: atmosphere,

0:13:37.3 S1: which

0:13:37.5 S1: the

0:13:37.7 S1: students

0:13:38.1 S1: were

0:13:38.4 S1: disappointed

0:13:39.0 S1: to

0:13:39.2 S1: find

0:13:39.4 S1: out

0:13:39.8 S1: overall,

0:13:40.7 S1: just

0:13:41.0 S1: as

0:13:41.1 S1: a

0:13:42.4 S1: fact.

0:13:44.9 S1: Bob

0:13:46.9 S1: felt

0:13:49.4 S1: sad.

0:13:50.9 S1: He

0:13:51.1 S1: realized

0:13:51.5 S1: that

0:13:51.8 S1: his

0:13:52.0 S1: time

0:13:52.2 S1: was

0:13:52.4 S1: about

0:13:52.7 S1: to

0:13:52.9 S1: come

0:13:53.5 S1: and

0:13:53.7 S1: he

0:13:53.8 S1: was

0:13:54.0 S1: about

0:13:55.3 S1: to

0:13:55.8 S1: leave

0:13:56.4 S1: the

0:13:56.9 S1: earth

0:13:57.5 S1: and

0:13:58.0 S1: return

0:13:58.7 S1: home

0:13:59.3 S1: finally.

0:14:00.2 S2: So

0:14:00.4 S2: each

0:14:00.5 S2: of

0:14:00.7 S2: the

0:14:00.8 S2: students

0:14:01.3 S2: took

0:14:01.5 S2: turns

0:14:01.9 S2: saying

0:14:02.1 S2: farewell

0:14:02.9 S2: to

0:14:03.1 S2: Bob

0:14:03.5 S2: and

0:14:03.7 S2: it

0:14:03.8 S2: was

0:14:04.0 S2: a

0:14:04.1 S2: very

0:14:04.4 S2: touching

0:14:04.8 S2: affair,

0:14:06.1 S2: they

0:14:06.3 S2: took

0:14:06.5 S2: time

0:14:07.1 S2: to

0:14:07.3 S2: share

0:14:07.5 S2: with

0:14:07.7 S2: him

0:14:09.3 S2: their

0:14:09.5 S2: gratitude

0:14:10.4 S2: of

0:14:10.5 S2: some

0:14:10.7 S2: of

0:14:10.8 S2: their

0:14:11.0 S2: favorite

0:14:11.4 S2: memories,

0:14:12.1 S2: they

0:14:12.1 S2: even

0:14:13.0 S2: gave

0:14:13.8 S2: him

0:14:14.0 S2: some

0:14:14.2 S2: gifts.

0:14:15.8 S2: One

0:14:16.0 S2: of

0:14:16.1 S2: them

0:14:16.4 S2: always

0:14:17.1 S2: carried

0:14:17.6 S2: a

0:14:17.9 S2: stone

0:14:18.6 S2: in

0:14:18.9 S2: her

0:14:19.2 S2: pocket

0:14:20.5 S2: that

0:14:20.8 S2: she

0:14:21.0 S2: had

0:14:21.2 S2: gathered

0:14:21.6 S2: from

0:14:21.8 S2: her

0:14:22.1 S2: child

0:14:22.8 S2: play

0:14:23.2 S2: school,

0:14:24.7 S2: and

0:14:25.0 S2: she

0:14:25.3 S2: felt

0:14:25.7 S2: that

0:14:25.9 S2: Bob

0:14:26.2 S2: should

0:14:26.3 S2: take

0:14:26.5 S2: it

0:14:26.6 S2: with

0:14:26.8 S2: him

0:14:27.0 S2: on

0:14:27.2 S2: his

0:14:27.4 S2: galactic

0:14:27.8 S2: adventures.

0:14:28.8 S1: Bob

0:14:30.3 S1: was

0:14:30.5 S1: touched

0:14:31.5 S1: and

0:14:32.0 S1: he

0:14:32.2 S1: couldn't

0:14:32.5 S1: handle

0:14:33.0 S1: any

0:14:33.3 S1: more

0:14:33.7 S1: goodbyes

0:14:34.4 S1: so

0:14:34.6 S1: he

0:14:34.8 S1: boarded

0:14:35.4 S1: his

0:14:35.7 S1: spaceship,

0:14:36.5 S1: got

0:14:36.8 S1: in

0:14:37.0 S1: with

0:14:37.4 S1: his

0:14:37.7 S1: friends

0:14:38.3 S1: and

0:14:38.4 S1: it

0:14:38.6 S1: went

0:14:38.6 S1: away

0:14:40.3 S1: in

0:14:40.9 S1: a

0:14:41.0 S1: blinding

0:14:41.5 S1: flash

0:14:41.8 S1: of

0:14:42.0 S1: light.

0:14:42.4 S1: The

0:14:42.5 S1: students

0:14:43.0 S1: were

0:14:43.4 S1: sad

0:14:44.3 S1: but

0:14:44.5 S1: then

0:14:44.8 S1: ultimately

0:14:45.4 S1: horrified

0:14:46.4 S1: when

0:14:46.6 S1: they

0:14:46.8 S1: realized

0:14:47.2 S1: they

0:14:47.4 S1: had

0:14:47.5 S1: just

0:14:47.7 S1: met

0:14:48.1 S1: two

0:14:48.5 S1: aliens

0:14:49.0 S1: and

0:14:49.2 S1: they

0:14:49.3 S1: hadn't

0:14:49.4 S1: documented

0:14:49.5 S1: a

0:14:49.6 S1: single

0:14:51.2 S1: bit

0:14:51.9 S1: of

0:14:52.0 S1: it.

0:14:52.5 S1: No

0:14:52.7 S1: one

0:14:52.9 S1: would

0:14:53.2 S1: believe

0:14:53.6 S1: them.

0:14:54.2 S1: Larry

0:14:54.6 S1: started

0:14:54.9 S1: screaming

0:14:55.8 S1: and

0:14:55.8 S1: screaming

0:14:56.7 S1: at

0:14:56.9 S1: the

0:14:57.1 S1: missed...
