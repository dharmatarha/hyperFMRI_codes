0:00:00.0 S1: They

0:00:01.0 S1: were

0:00:01.8 S1: five

0:00:03.9 S1: students,

0:00:07.4 S1: and

0:00:07.4 S1: they

0:00:07.4 S1: decided

0:00:07.4 S1: to

0:00:07.4 S1: go

0:00:07.5 S1: to

0:00:07.5 S1: Maine

0:00:07.5 S1: on

0:00:07.6 S1: a

0:00:07.9 S1: camping

0:00:09.1 S1: trip.

0:00:09.8 S1: It's

0:00:10.6 S1: pretty

0:00:11.6 S1: deserted,

0:00:13.0 S1: they

0:00:13.7 S1: got

0:00:14.3 S1: into

0:00:15.1 S1: the

0:00:15.5 S1: log

0:00:16.0 S1: cabin,

0:00:16.6 S1: and

0:00:16.9 S1: were

0:00:17.7 S1: settling

0:00:17.9 S1: down

0:00:18.9 S1: for

0:00:19.9 S1: dinner,

0:00:20.5 S1: and

0:00:22.0 S1: then

0:00:22.3 S1: they

0:00:22.6 S1: heard

0:00:22.8 S1: a

0:00:23.5 S1: loud

0:00:23.9 S1: noise

0:00:24.5 S1: and

0:00:25.0 S1: went

0:00:25.2 S1: outside

0:00:25.9 S1: to

0:00:26.2 S1: see

0:00:26.3 S1: what

0:00:26.5 S1: it

0:00:26.5 S1: was

0:00:26.6 S1: about.

0:00:29.6 S1: And

0:00:31.1 S1: when

0:00:31.2 S1: they

0:00:31.4 S1: got

0:00:31.6 S1: outside,

0:00:33.4 S1: they

0:00:33.7 S1: saw

0:00:34.2 S1: a

0:00:34.2 S1: lot

0:00:34.4 S1: of

0:00:36.9 S1: smoke,

0:00:37.6 S1: and

0:00:39.2 S1: some

0:00:39.5 S1: trees

0:00:39.8 S1: had

0:00:40.0 S1: been

0:00:40.2 S1: knocked

0:00:40.5 S1: down.

0:00:40.9 S1: And

0:00:41.1 S1: they

0:00:41.3 S1: went

0:00:41.5 S1: over

0:00:41.7 S1: to

0:00:41.8 S1: see

0:00:42.0 S1: what

0:00:42.5 S1: has

0:00:42.9 S1: happened.

0:00:44.2 S1: And

0:00:45.9 S1: there

0:00:46.2 S1: was

0:00:49.4 S1: a

0:00:49.6 S1: giant

0:00:50.3 S1: metal

0:00:51.7 S1: ship

0:00:52.1 S1: that

0:00:52.4 S1: had

0:00:52.7 S1: fallen

0:00:53.2 S1: and

0:00:53.4 S1: knocked

0:00:54.0 S1: over

0:00:54.3 S1: a

0:00:54.4 S1: bunch

0:00:54.9 S1: of

0:00:55.1 S1: trees,

0:00:55.5 S1: and

0:00:55.7 S1: they

0:00:56.1 S1: can...

0:00:56.3 S1: An

0:00:56.5 S1: eerie

0:00:56.9 S1: sound

0:00:57.3 S1: coming

0:00:57.8 S1: from

0:00:58.0 S1: it.

0:01:00.5 S1: They

0:01:00.8 S1: were

0:01:01.9 S1: scared

0:01:02.4 S1: obviously,

0:01:03.2 S1: but

0:01:03.4 S1: also

0:01:03.9 S1: curious,

0:01:04.9 S1: so

0:01:05.3 S1: they

0:01:05.9 S1: went

0:01:06.6 S1: to

0:01:07.0 S1: approach

0:01:08.1 S1: it.

0:01:08.5 S1: Three

0:01:09.3 S1: of

0:01:09.7 S1: them

0:01:10.4 S1: were

0:01:11.0 S1: hesitant,

0:01:12.2 S1: but

0:01:12.7 S1: two

0:01:13.2 S1: of

0:01:13.6 S1: them

0:01:14.1 S1: really

0:01:14.9 S1: wanted

0:01:15.3 S1: to

0:01:15.4 S1: check

0:01:15.6 S1: it

0:01:15.8 S1: out,

0:01:17.3 S1: they

0:01:19.3 S1: went

0:01:19.9 S1: over

0:01:20.4 S1: to

0:01:20.8 S1: it.

0:01:21.1 S1: At

0:01:21.5 S1: first,

0:01:22.2 S1: there

0:01:22.8 S1: was

0:01:23.1 S1: no

0:01:23.5 S1: sign

0:01:24.0 S1: of

0:01:24.4 S1: life

0:01:25.0 S1: or

0:01:25.3 S1: anything

0:01:26.4 S1: but

0:01:26.9 S1: then,

0:01:27.5 S1: a

0:01:27.6 S1: door

0:01:28.7 S1: opened.

0:01:29.6 S1: And

0:01:29.8 S1: then

0:01:30.0 S1: they

0:01:30.2 S1: had

0:01:30.4 S1: a

0:01:30.5 S1: voice

0:01:32.1 S1: saying,

0:01:33.9 S1: "Hi,

0:01:34.4 S1: sorry

0:01:34.7 S1: to

0:01:34.9 S1: bother

0:01:35.3 S1: you,

0:01:35.5 S1: we

0:01:35.7 S1: just

0:01:35.9 S1: stopped

0:01:36.2 S1: off

0:01:36.4 S1: for

0:01:36.6 S1: some

0:01:36.9 S1: food,

0:01:37.3 S1: we're

0:01:37.5 S1: very

0:01:37.8 S1: hungry.

0:01:38.9 S1: And [laughter]

0:01:40.7 S1: we'd

0:01:41.0 S1: like

0:01:41.2 S1: to

0:01:41.4 S1: order

0:01:42.7 S1: a

0:01:42.9 S1: couple

0:01:43.6 S1: sandwiches,

0:01:44.9 S1: and

0:01:45.9 S1: some

0:01:46.3 S1: beer,

0:01:47.0 S1: and

0:01:47.4 S1: couple

0:01:48.2 S1: sodas

0:01:49.0 S1: if

0:01:49.2 S1: you

0:01:49.4 S1: have

0:01:49.7 S1: it.

0:01:51.6 S1: If

0:01:51.8 S1: you

0:01:51.9 S1: could

0:01:52.1 S1: just

0:01:52.2 S1: throw

0:01:52.4 S1: them

0:01:52.7 S1: into

0:01:52.9 S1: our

0:01:53.1 S1: ship,

0:01:53.4 S1: we'd

0:01:53.6 S1: be

0:01:53.7 S1: very

0:01:54.0 S1: happy."

0:01:55.9 S1: And

0:01:56.0 S1: the

0:01:56.2 S1: students

0:01:56.5 S1: didn't

0:01:56.9 S1: know

0:01:57.1 S1: what

0:01:57.3 S1: to

0:01:57.5 S1: do.

0:02:01.0 S1: They

0:01:58.2 S1: were,

0:01:58.6 S1: obviously,

0:01:59.4 S1: very

0:01:59.8 S1: confused,

0:02:02.4 S1: but

0:02:03.9 S1: they

0:02:05.3 S1: went

0:02:05.5 S1: to

0:02:05.8 S1: check

0:02:06.4 S1: out

0:02:06.8 S1: the

0:02:07.2 S1: faces,

0:02:07.7 S1: and

0:02:08.1 S1: there

0:02:08.6 S1: were

0:02:09.0 S1: shocked

0:02:09.7 S1: to

0:02:09.9 S1: find

0:02:10.3 S1: that

0:02:10.8 S1: they

0:02:11.1 S1: looked

0:02:11.3 S1: just

0:02:11.7 S1: like

0:02:12.1 S1: them,

0:02:12.4 S1: just

0:02:12.7 S1: normal

0:02:14.0 S1: human

0:02:14.3 S1: beings.

0:02:16.9 S1: But

0:02:17.5 S1: they

0:02:19.2 S1: were

0:02:19.4 S1: obviously

0:02:21.2 S1: a

0:02:21.2 S1: little

0:02:21.4 S1: bit

0:02:21.6 S1: different,

0:02:23.3 S1: if...

0:02:23.9 S1: Their

0:02:24.2 S1: skin

0:02:24.5 S1: color

0:02:25.0 S1: was

0:02:25.1 S1: different,

0:02:25.5 S1: there

0:02:25.7 S1: they

0:02:25.9 S1: was

0:02:26.4 S1: purple.

0:02:29.7 S1: And

0:02:30.8 S1: from

0:02:31.0 S1: the

0:02:31.2 S1: front,

0:02:31.4 S1: they

0:02:31.6 S1: looked

0:02:31.8 S1: like

0:02:32.0 S1: totally

0:02:32.3 S1: normal

0:02:32.8 S1: people.

0:02:33.3 S1: But

0:02:33.6 S1: then

0:02:34.1 S1: when

0:02:34.4 S1: they

0:02:34.6 S1: turned

0:02:35.0 S1: around,

0:02:37.1 S1: their

0:02:37.3 S1: entire

0:02:37.9 S1: back

0:02:38.3 S1: side

0:02:39.6 S1: was

0:02:40.7 S1: glowing

0:02:43.1 S1: red.

0:02:44.3 S1: And

0:02:45.3 S1: they

0:02:45.5 S1: said

0:02:45.7 S1: that

0:02:45.9 S1: they

0:02:46.1 S1: were

0:02:46.5 S1: glowing

0:02:46.8 S1: red

0:02:47.1 S1: because

0:02:47.4 S1: they

0:02:47.5 S1: were

0:02:47.7 S1: low

0:02:47.8 S1: on

0:02:48.1 S1: fuel,

0:02:49.0 S1: so

0:02:49.4 S1: they

0:02:49.5 S1: needed

0:02:49.8 S1: some

0:02:50.2 S1: food

0:02:50.7 S1: to

0:02:51.4 S1: re-

0:02:51.6 S1: up

0:02:51.9 S1: their

0:02:52.7 S1: batteries,

0:02:54.0 S1: so

0:02:54.2 S1: they

0:02:54.5 S1: could

0:02:54.8 S1: make

0:02:55.1 S1: the

0:02:55.3 S1: rest

0:02:55.8 S1: of

0:02:56.0 S1: their

0:02:56.2 S1: trip.

0:02:57.1 S1: They

0:02:58.0 S1: seemed

0:02:59.1 S1: friendly,

0:02:59.7 S1: so

0:03:01.3 S1: they

0:03:01.5 S1: brought

0:03:01.7 S1: them

0:03:02.5 S1: back

0:03:02.9 S1: into

0:03:03.1 S1: their

0:03:03.6 S1: cabin,

0:03:04.0 S1: and

0:03:05.0 S1: decided

0:03:05.7 S1: to

0:03:07.2 S1: share

0:03:07.4 S1: their

0:03:07.6 S1: food

0:03:07.9 S1: with

0:03:08.1 S1: them.

0:03:08.7 S1: They

0:03:08.9 S1: had

0:03:09.7 S1: burgers

0:03:10.3 S1: and

0:03:10.6 S1: hot

0:03:11.0 S1: dogs,

0:03:11.4 S1: and

0:03:11.7 S1: when

0:03:12.0 S1: they

0:03:12.2 S1: offered

0:03:12.8 S1: the

0:03:12.8 S1: food

0:03:12.9 S1: to

0:03:13.0 S1: the

0:03:13.0 S1: aliens,

0:03:13.1 S1: the

0:03:13.2 S1: aliens

0:03:13.3 S1: looked

0:03:13.4 S1: horrified.

0:03:13.6 S1: They

0:03:13.6 S1: told

0:03:13.7 S1: them

0:03:13.8 S1: they

0:03:13.9 S1: don't

0:03:13.9 S1: eat

0:03:14.0 S1: meat,

0:03:14.1 S1: so

0:03:14.1 S1: they

0:03:14.2 S1: had

0:03:14.3 S1: to

0:03:21.7 S1: find

0:03:24.2 S1: some

0:03:26.2 S1: other

0:03:26.6 S1: meal

0:03:27.4 S1: to

0:03:27.8 S1: give

0:03:28.6 S1: them.

0:03:29.3 S1: The

0:03:29.9 S1: aliens

0:03:30.8 S1: were

0:03:31.2 S1: pretty

0:03:31.6 S1: surprised

0:03:32.2 S1: that

0:03:32.5 S1: these

0:03:32.9 S1: humans

0:03:33.8 S1: were

0:03:34.1 S1: eating

0:03:34.4 S1: meat.

0:03:34.7 S1: They

0:03:34.9 S1: had

0:03:35.1 S1: heard

0:03:36.1 S1: on

0:03:36.3 S1: their

0:03:36.5 S1: last

0:03:36.9 S1: trip

0:03:37.6 S1: near

0:03:37.9 S1: Earth

0:03:38.3 S1: that

0:03:39.3 S1: everyone

0:03:39.8 S1: on

0:03:39.8 S1: Earth

0:03:40.0 S1: thought

0:03:40.3 S1: it

0:03:40.3 S1: was

0:03:40.5 S1: really

0:03:40.8 S1: cool

0:03:41.1 S1: to

0:03:41.3 S1: become

0:03:41.6 S1: vegetarian,

0:03:44.2 S1: lately. [laughter]

0:03:44.7 S1: And

0:03:45.0 S1: so

0:03:45.3 S1: they

0:03:45.6 S1: were

0:03:46.0 S1: surprised

0:03:46.3 S1: these

0:03:46.8 S1: young

0:03:47.2 S1: people

0:03:47.7 S1: were

0:03:48.0 S1: also...

0:03:49.4 S1: And

0:03:50.1 S1: students

0:03:50.5 S1: ask

0:03:50.8 S1: them

0:03:51.1 S1: where

0:03:51.9 S1: they

0:03:52.1 S1: were

0:03:52.3 S1: going

0:03:53.0 S1: on

0:03:53.4 S1: their

0:03:54.1 S1: trip,

0:03:54.6 S1: and

0:03:54.8 S1: the

0:03:54.9 S1: aliens

0:03:55.3 S1: said

0:03:55.5 S1: that

0:03:55.6 S1: they

0:03:55.8 S1: were

0:03:56.1 S1: on

0:03:56.3 S1: a

0:03:56.4 S1: vacation

0:03:57.0 S1: with

0:03:57.3 S1: their

0:03:57.7 S1: kids

0:03:58.0 S1: taking

0:03:58.2 S1: a

0:03:58.4 S1: road

0:03:58.7 S1: trip.

0:04:01.5 S1: Yeah,

0:04:01.7 S1: they're

0:04:01.9 S1: going

0:04:02.5 S1: through

0:04:03.2 S1: the

0:04:03.5 S1: Milky

0:04:04.6 S1: Way

0:04:05.3 S1: galaxy

0:04:06.5 S1: on

0:04:07.1 S1: a

0:04:07.4 S1: road

0:04:08.3 S1: trip,

0:04:09.0 S1: on

0:04:09.3 S1: vacation.

0:04:10.1 S1: It

0:04:10.7 S1: was

0:04:11.5 S1: their

0:04:12.6 S1: usual

0:04:13.6 S1: winter

0:04:14.1 S1: break

0:04:16.0 S1: vacation.

0:04:18.6 S1: I

0:04:18.7 S1: guess

0:04:18.9 S1: the

0:04:19.0 S1: kids

0:04:19.3 S1: wanted

0:04:19.6 S1: to

0:04:19.9 S1: see

0:04:20.2 S1: just

0:04:21.7 S1: what

0:04:21.8 S1: it

0:04:21.9 S1: was

0:04:22.1 S1: like

0:04:22.3 S1: down

0:04:22.5 S1: all

0:04:22.7 S1: the

0:04:22.8 S1: other

0:04:23.1 S1: planets,

0:04:25.2 S1: and

0:04:25.8 S1: that's

0:04:26.0 S1: why

0:04:26.2 S1: they

0:04:26.4 S1: went.

0:04:29.4 S1: Yeah,

0:04:29.6 S1: and

0:04:30.2 S1: they

0:04:30.5 S1: said

0:04:30.7 S1: they

0:04:30.9 S1: normally

0:04:31.4 S1: packed

0:04:31.8 S1: more

0:04:32.1 S1: food

0:04:32.7 S1: to

0:04:33.0 S1: eat.

0:04:33.5 S1: But

0:04:33.8 S1: they

0:04:33.9 S1: had

0:04:34.1 S1: gotten

0:04:34.4 S1: in

0:04:34.5 S1: a

0:04:34.6 S1: big

0:04:34.8 S1: argument

0:04:35.2 S1: when

0:04:35.3 S1: they

0:04:35.5 S1: were

0:04:35.6 S1: packing

0:04:36.0 S1: for

0:04:36.2 S1: the

0:04:36.4 S1: trip,

0:04:37.3 S1: and

0:04:37.6 S1: everything

0:04:38.0 S1: was

0:04:38.2 S1: in

0:04:38.3 S1: such

0:04:38.5 S1: a

0:04:38.7 S1: hurry.

0:04:39.5 S1: And

0:04:40.1 S1: the

0:04:40.5 S1: wife

0:04:40.8 S1: was

0:04:41.0 S1: angry

0:04:41.2 S1: at

0:04:41.5 S1: the

0:04:41.6 S1: husband

0:04:41.9 S1: because

0:04:42.2 S1: he

0:04:42.3 S1: didn't

0:04:42.6 S1: go

0:04:42.7 S1: to

0:04:42.8 S1: the

0:04:42.9 S1: market,

0:04:43.9 S1: and

0:04:44.1 S1: get

0:04:44.3 S1: the

0:04:44.5 S1: right

0:04:44.8 S1: snacks

0:04:45.3 S1: for

0:04:45.5 S1: the

0:04:45.6 S1: kids.

0:04:46.7 S1: And

0:04:46.9 S1: then

0:04:47.1 S1: the

0:04:47.3 S1: kids

0:04:47.6 S1: were

0:04:47.8 S1: complaining

0:04:48.6 S1: about

0:04:48.9 S1: having

0:04:49.3 S1: to

0:04:49.5 S1: share

0:04:49.7 S1: a

0:04:49.9 S1: bedroom

0:04:50.4 S1: while

0:04:50.6 S1: they

0:04:50.8 S1: were

0:04:50.9 S1: in

0:04:51.0 S1: their

0:04:51.3 S1: travel

0:04:51.8 S1: spaceship,

0:04:52.7 S1: and

0:04:53.0 S1: it

0:04:53.1 S1: was

0:04:53.3 S1: just

0:04:53.5 S1: such

0:04:53.7 S1: a

0:04:53.8 S1: mess

0:04:54.0 S1: that

0:04:54.2 S1: they

0:04:54.3 S1: decided

0:04:54.7 S1: to

0:04:54.8 S1: just

0:04:55.1 S1: take

0:04:55.4 S1: off,

0:04:55.7 S1: and

0:04:56.4 S1: they

0:04:56.6 S1: didn't

0:04:56.8 S1: really

0:04:57.3 S1: pack

0:04:57.7 S1: properly.

0:04:58.4 S1: Yeah,

0:05:00.2 S1: they

0:05:00.8 S1: didn't

0:05:01.5 S1: pack

0:05:02.1 S1: enough

0:05:02.8 S1: food.

0:05:03.4 S1: Felt

0:05:03.8 S1: very

0:05:04.1 S1: grateful

0:05:04.9 S1: to

0:05:05.6 S1: the

0:05:05.9 S1: human

0:05:06.4 S1: beings

0:05:06.8 S1: for

0:05:07.0 S1: giving

0:05:07.3 S1: them

0:05:09.5 S1: buns

0:05:09.9 S1: and

0:05:10.3 S1: salads.

0:05:10.8 S1: And

0:05:11.1 S1: once

0:05:11.8 S1: they

0:05:12.5 S1: ate

0:05:13.1 S1: enough

0:05:14.0 S1: food

0:05:14.7 S1: their

0:05:15.5 S1: backsides

0:05:16.8 S1: were

0:05:17.0 S1: no

0:05:17.2 S1: longer

0:05:17.6 S1: red.

0:05:18.7 S1: And

0:05:19.1 S1: they

0:05:19.3 S1: were

0:05:19.4 S1: able

0:05:19.6 S1: to

0:05:20.6 S1: have

0:05:20.7 S1: a

0:05:20.8 S1: real

0:05:20.9 S1: conversation

0:05:21.5 S1: about

0:05:22.0 S1: the

0:05:22.2 S1: difference

0:05:22.8 S1: between

0:05:23.3 S1: human

0:05:23.9 S1: beings

0:05:24.6 S1: and

0:05:25.0 S1: aliens,

0:05:25.8 S1: other

0:05:26.3 S1: than

0:05:26.8 S1: being

0:05:27.0 S1: able

0:05:27.3 S1: to

0:05:28.2 S1: travel

0:05:28.5 S1: through

0:05:28.7 S1: the

0:05:28.9 S1: galaxy.

0:05:31.1 S1: Yeah,

0:05:31.7 S1: one

0:05:31.9 S1: thing

0:05:32.1 S1: about

0:05:32.4 S1: aliens

0:05:32.9 S1: is

0:05:33.1 S1: that

0:05:33.2 S1: they

0:05:33.4 S1: can

0:05:33.6 S1: understand

0:05:35.0 S1: any

0:05:35.4 S1: language

0:05:36.3 S1: because

0:05:37.7 S1: they

0:05:37.8 S1: don't

0:05:38.1 S1: actually

0:05:38.5 S1: listen

0:05:38.9 S1: to

0:05:39.0 S1: the

0:05:39.2 S1: words,

0:05:39.7 S1: they

0:05:40.0 S1: just

0:05:40.2 S1: pick

0:05:40.4 S1: up

0:05:40.7 S1: on

0:05:41.2 S1: peoples'

0:05:41.8 S1: body

0:05:42.3 S1: cues.

0:05:43.3 S1: And

0:05:43.7 S1: they're

0:05:44.2 S1: like...

0:05:44.4 S1: How

0:05:44.6 S1: they're

0:05:44.9 S1: feeling,

0:05:47.2 S1: and

0:05:47.2 S1: like

0:05:47.2 S1: things

0:05:47.5 S1: like

0:05:47.7 S1: that.

0:05:47.9 S1: So

0:05:48.0 S1: it

0:05:48.1 S1: doesn't

0:05:48.4 S1: matter

0:05:48.7 S1: what

0:05:48.8 S1: words

0:05:49.1 S1: you

0:05:49.3 S1: actually

0:05:49.7 S1: say,

0:05:50.5 S1: as

0:05:50.7 S1: long

0:05:50.9 S1: as

0:05:51.0 S1: you

0:05:51.2 S1: emote

0:05:51.8 S1: properly,

0:05:53.0 S1: the

0:05:53.3 S1: aliens

0:05:53.6 S1: will

0:05:53.8 S1: understand

0:05:54.2 S1: you.

0:05:54.3 S1: That

0:05:54.5 S1: was

0:05:54.6 S1: one

0:05:54.8 S1: of

0:05:54.9 S1: the

0:05:55.0 S1: differences

0:05:55.5 S1: that

0:05:55.7 S1: they

0:05:55.9 S1: talked

0:05:56.1 S1: about,

0:05:56.3 S1: was

0:05:56.5 S1: communication.

0:06:00.5 S1: And

0:06:00.8 S1: they

0:06:00.9 S1: were

0:06:01.1 S1: able

0:06:01.3 S1: to

0:06:01.5 S1: pick

0:06:01.6 S1: up

0:06:01.6 S1: that

0:06:02.0 S1: there

0:06:02.2 S1: was

0:06:02.3 S1: a

0:06:02.4 S1: lot

0:06:02.6 S1: of

0:06:03.4 S1: tension

0:06:04.0 S1: in

0:06:04.1 S1: the

0:06:04.3 S1: room

0:06:04.5 S1: between

0:06:04.9 S1: the

0:06:05.0 S1: human

0:06:05.8 S1: beings.

0:06:06.8 S1: They

0:06:07.4 S1: started

0:06:08.4 S1: to

0:06:09.0 S1: inquire

0:06:10.0 S1: as

0:06:10.2 S1: to

0:06:10.5 S1: what

0:06:11.0 S1: had

0:06:11.2 S1: happened

0:06:12.0 S1: to

0:06:12.1 S1: them

0:06:12.5 S1: because

0:06:12.8 S1: they

0:06:13.0 S1: felt

0:06:13.2 S1: a

0:06:13.4 S1: lot

0:06:13.5 S1: of

0:06:14.8 S1: resentment

0:06:15.8 S1: and

0:06:16.2 S1: sadness.

0:06:17.7 S1: They

0:06:18.6 S1: started

0:06:20.1 S1: to

0:06:20.7 S1: ask

0:06:21.2 S1: the

0:06:21.4 S1: human

0:06:21.5 S1: beings

0:06:21.6 S1: about

0:06:21.8 S1: their

0:06:21.9 S1: personal

0:06:22.0 S1: lives,

0:06:22.1 S1: and

0:06:22.3 S1: it

0:06:22.6 S1: kinda

0:06:23.6 S1: turned

0:06:23.9 S1: into

0:06:24.1 S1: a

0:06:24.8 S1: therapy

0:06:25.3 S1: session.

0:06:29.2 S1: One

0:06:29.4 S1: of

0:06:29.5 S1: the

0:06:29.6 S1: aliens

0:06:30.0 S1: was

0:06:30.3 S1: actually

0:06:30.8 S1: a

0:06:31.0 S1: talk

0:06:31.4 S1: show

0:06:31.7 S1: host

0:06:32.0 S1: on

0:06:32.3 S1: his

0:06:32.5 S1: home

0:06:32.9 S1: planet,

0:06:33.3 S1: a

0:06:33.4 S1: lot

0:06:33.6 S1: like

0:06:33.8 S1: Dr.

0:06:34.2 S1: Phil.

0:06:34.6 S1: So

0:06:36.1 S1: it

0:06:36.2 S1: was [chuckle]

0:06:36.7 S1: really

0:06:37.0 S1: convenient

0:06:38.5 S1: for

0:06:38.5 S1: them

0:06:38.5 S1: to

0:06:38.7 S1: have

0:06:39.4 S1: him

0:06:39.9 S1: there

0:06:40.5 S1: to

0:06:40.9 S1: mediate

0:06:41.7 S1: because

0:06:42.9 S1: one

0:06:43.0 S1: of

0:06:43.1 S1: the

0:06:43.4 S1: students

0:06:44.9 S1: had

0:06:45.2 S1: just

0:06:45.4 S1: found

0:06:45.7 S1: out

0:06:46.2 S1: that

0:06:47.9 S1: one

0:06:48.0 S1: of

0:06:48.1 S1: the

0:06:48.3 S1: other

0:06:48.8 S1: students

0:06:49.4 S1: had

0:06:49.7 S1: told

0:06:50.0 S1: her

0:06:50.3 S1: not

0:06:50.6 S1: to

0:06:50.7 S1: apply

0:06:51.1 S1: for

0:06:51.3 S1: a

0:06:51.4 S1: job

0:06:51.8 S1: she

0:06:52.1 S1: wanted,

0:06:53.0 S1: and

0:06:53.1 S1: then

0:06:53.4 S1: he

0:06:53.6 S1: applied

0:06:54.1 S1: for

0:06:54.3 S1: it

0:06:54.9 S1: instead

0:06:56.5 S1: and

0:06:57.1 S1: used

0:06:57.7 S1: some

0:06:58.3 S1: of

0:06:58.7 S1: her

0:06:59.1 S1: material.

0:07:00.3 S2: So

0:07:00.5 S2: they

0:07:00.7 S2: were

0:07:01.0 S2: obviously

0:07:01.9 S2: unhappy

0:07:02.9 S2: with

0:07:03.3 S2: each

0:07:03.6 S2: other.

0:07:04.5 S2: To

0:07:04.6 S2: make

0:07:05.6 S2: matters

0:07:06.1 S2: worse,

0:07:06.8 S2: they

0:07:06.8 S2: had

0:07:06.9 S2: been

0:07:06.9 S2: dating

0:07:07.8 S2: for

0:07:08.2 S2: five

0:07:08.6 S2: years,

0:07:09.2 S2: so

0:07:10.4 S2: it

0:07:10.5 S2: was

0:07:11.0 S2: a

0:07:11.2 S2: ultimate

0:07:13.4 S2: decision

0:07:13.8 S2: position

0:07:14.2 S2: between

0:07:14.5 S2: romance

0:07:14.8 S2: and

0:07:15.3 S2: career.

0:07:17.6 S2: So

0:07:17.9 S2: the

0:07:18.4 S2: aliens

0:07:19.1 S2: that

0:07:19.3 S2: was

0:07:19.5 S2: the

0:07:19.6 S2: talk

0:07:20.0 S2: show

0:07:20.3 S2: host

0:07:20.6 S2: tried

0:07:20.9 S2: to

0:07:21.1 S2: mediate

0:07:21.6 S2: between

0:07:22.1 S2: them

0:07:22.4 S2: and

0:07:22.6 S2: tried

0:07:23.4 S2: to

0:07:23.8 S2: resolve

0:07:24.9 S2: the

0:07:25.5 S2: situation

0:07:26.7 S2: but

0:07:27.5 S2: it

0:07:27.8 S2: seemed

0:07:28.2 S2: like

0:07:28.6 S2: there

0:07:28.7 S2: was

0:07:28.9 S2: no

0:07:29.0 S2: solution.

0:07:30.7 S1: Yeah,

0:07:31.2 S1: then

0:07:32.1 S1: he

0:07:32.2 S1: was

0:07:32.4 S1: thinking

0:07:33.2 S1: and

0:07:33.5 S1: he

0:07:33.6 S1: was

0:07:33.8 S1: like,

0:07:34.0 S1: "You

0:07:34.2 S1: know,

0:07:34.5 S1: it

0:07:34.6 S1: would

0:07:34.7 S1: be

0:07:34.9 S1: so

0:07:35.3 S1: great

0:07:35.6 S1: for

0:07:35.8 S1: my

0:07:36.1 S1: ratings

0:07:36.7 S1: if

0:07:36.9 S1: I

0:07:37.0 S1: could

0:07:37.1 S1: have

0:07:37.4 S1: two

0:07:37.9 S1: humans

0:07:39.1 S1: on

0:07:39.4 S1: my

0:07:39.7 S1: show

0:07:40.1 S1: arguing

0:07:41.7 S1: about

0:07:41.9 S1: their

0:07:42.1 S1: mundane

0:07:42.6 S1: lives

0:07:42.9 S1: people

0:07:43.2 S1: would

0:07:43.5 S1: absolutely

0:07:44.7 S1: love

0:07:44.9 S1: it...

0:07:45.2 S1: Aliens

0:07:45.9 S1: would

0:07:46.5 S1: absolutely

0:07:47.6 S1: love

0:07:48.1 S1: it,"

0:07:48.4 S1: excuse

0:07:49.0 S1: me.

0:07:49.3 S1: And

0:07:49.7 S1: so

0:07:50.0 S1: he

0:07:50.2 S1: was

0:07:50.4 S1: like,

0:07:50.7 S1: "How

0:07:50.8 S1: would

0:07:51.0 S1: you

0:07:51.2 S1: guys

0:07:51.6 S1: feel

0:07:51.9 S1: about

0:07:52.1 S1: visiting

0:07:52.6 S1: us

0:07:53.0 S1: and

0:07:53.2 S1: coming

0:07:53.7 S1: on

0:07:53.9 S1: my

0:07:54.2 S1: show?

0:07:55.4 S1: And

0:07:55.8 S1: I'll

0:07:56.0 S1: pay

0:07:56.4 S1: you

0:07:56.7 S1: in

0:07:57.7 S1: gold

0:07:59.5 S1: bars." [chuckle]

0:08:00.9 S2: So

0:08:01.2 S2: the

0:08:01.4 S2: humans

0:08:01.7 S2: were

0:08:01.9 S2: really

0:08:02.1 S2: excited

0:08:02.8 S2: about

0:08:03.1 S2: that

0:08:03.5 S2: idea

0:08:03.8 S2: so

0:08:04.3 S2: they

0:08:04.5 S2: decided

0:08:05.1 S2: on

0:08:05.5 S2: get

0:08:06.1 S2: back

0:08:06.8 S2: on

0:08:07.2 S2: the

0:08:07.7 S2: space

0:08:08.6 S2: ship

0:08:09.1 S2: with

0:08:09.4 S2: the

0:08:10.0 S2: aliens

0:08:11.9 S2: and

0:08:12.4 S2: travel

0:08:12.8 S2: back

0:08:13.1 S2: to

0:08:14.4 S2: their

0:08:14.9 S2: planet

0:08:16.0 S2: called

0:08:17.1 S2: Nardu.

0:08:18.0 S2: And

0:08:18.6 S2: they

0:08:19.4 S2: got

0:08:20.0 S2: into

0:08:20.8 S2: the

0:08:21.5 S2: ship

0:08:22.2 S2: and

0:08:22.9 S2: that

0:08:23.5 S2: was

0:08:23.6 S2: really

0:08:23.8 S2: cool.

0:08:24.3 S2: It

0:08:24.4 S2: was

0:08:24.5 S2: all

0:08:24.7 S2: these

0:08:25.1 S2: Mystic

0:08:26.2 S2: gadgets.

0:08:27.4 S2: Things

0:08:27.6 S2: that

0:08:27.7 S2: they

0:08:27.8 S2: hadn't

0:08:27.9 S2: seen

0:08:28.2 S2: before

0:08:28.7 S2: and

0:08:30.0 S2: there

0:08:30.2 S2: was

0:08:30.3 S2: a

0:08:30.4 S2: little

0:08:30.7 S2: bit

0:08:30.8 S2: of

0:08:30.9 S2: a

0:08:31.1 S2: dispute

0:08:31.7 S2: among

0:08:32.1 S2: my

0:08:32.3 S2: humans.

0:08:33.0 S2: How

0:08:33.3 S2: many

0:08:33.5 S2: of

0:08:33.6 S2: them

0:08:33.8 S2: should

0:08:34.2 S2: go

0:08:34.4 S2: and

0:08:34.6 S2: if

0:08:34.8 S2: any

0:08:35.0 S2: of

0:08:35.1 S2: them

0:08:35.3 S2: should

0:08:35.7 S2: stay

0:08:36.1 S2: or

0:08:36.2 S2: what

0:08:36.4 S2: should

0:08:36.6 S2: happen?

0:08:37.2 S2: So

0:08:38.1 S2: two

0:08:38.3 S2: of

0:08:38.5 S2: them

0:08:38.8 S2: stayed

0:08:39.0 S2: behind

0:08:40.1 S2: to

0:08:40.3 S2: record

0:08:40.9 S2: the

0:08:41.1 S2: event

0:08:41.6 S2: that

0:08:41.8 S2: had

0:08:42.0 S2: happened

0:08:42.4 S2: and

0:08:42.5 S2: share

0:08:42.8 S2: them

0:08:43.0 S2: with

0:08:43.2 S2: other

0:08:43.5 S2: humans

0:08:44.0 S2: and

0:08:44.9 S2: wait

0:08:45.2 S2: for

0:08:45.4 S2: the

0:08:45.5 S2: other

0:08:45.7 S2: ones

0:08:45.9 S2: return

0:08:46.6 S2: and

0:08:46.7 S2: then

0:08:46.7 S2: the

0:08:47.2 S2: other

0:08:47.4 S2: two

0:08:47.9 S2: that

0:08:48.2 S2: had

0:08:48.4 S2: been

0:08:48.7 S2: arguing,

0:08:49.2 S2: went

0:08:49.3 S2: off

0:08:49.5 S2: to

0:08:49.7 S2: be

0:08:49.7 S2: on

0:08:49.7 S2: the

0:08:50.3 S2: TV

0:08:50.5 S2: show.

0:08:50.9 S2: And

0:08:51.1 S2: they

0:08:51.2 S2: were

0:08:51.4 S2: super

0:08:51.7 S2: excited.

0:08:52.1 S2: The

0:08:52.2 S2: ship

0:08:52.4 S2: was

0:08:52.6 S2: really

0:08:53.0 S2: cool

0:08:54.3 S2: and

0:08:55.0 S2: they

0:08:55.2 S2: were

0:08:55.3 S2: about

0:08:55.5 S2: to

0:08:55.7 S2: take

0:08:56.0 S2: off

0:08:56.3 S2: and

0:08:56.5 S2: they

0:08:56.6 S2: were

0:08:56.8 S2: getting

0:08:57.1 S2: ready.

0:09:10.7 S2: And

0:09:11.1 S2: they

0:09:11.3 S2: launched

0:09:11.7 S2: into

0:09:11.9 S2: space,

0:09:12.1 S2: sorry

0:09:12.4 S2: I

0:09:12.4 S2: forgot

0:09:12.7 S2: what

0:09:12.9 S2: she

0:09:13.1 S2: said,

0:09:13.3 S2: So

0:09:13.4 S2: they

0:09:13.6 S2: launched

0:09:14.0 S2: into

0:09:14.2 S2: space

0:09:14.4 S2: and

0:09:14.6 S2: went

0:09:14.8 S2: to

0:09:14.9 S2: Nardu

0:09:15.1 S2: and

0:09:15.2 S2: then

0:09:15.6 S2: they

0:09:15.8 S2: noticed

0:09:16.3 S2: some

0:09:16.5 S2: of

0:09:16.7 S2: the

0:09:16.7 S2: strange

0:09:17.4 S2: things

0:09:18.4 S2: about

0:09:20.9 S2: the

0:09:21.1 S2: aliens.

0:09:21.6 S2: They

0:09:22.0 S2: seemed

0:09:22.5 S2: more

0:09:22.8 S2: demanding,

0:09:23.5 S2: not

0:09:23.7 S2: as

0:09:23.9 S2: friendly

0:09:24.3 S2: as

0:09:24.4 S2: when

0:09:24.6 S2: they

0:09:24.8 S2: first

0:09:25.7 S2: encountered

0:09:26.2 S2: them.

0:09:26.5 S2: They

0:09:27.1 S2: were

0:09:27.5 S2: a

0:09:27.6 S2: little

0:09:27.8 S2: bit

0:09:29.0 S2: afraid.

0:09:29.3 S1: Also,

0:09:30.9 S1: the

0:09:31.0 S1: aliens

0:09:31.5 S1: were

0:09:31.7 S1: super

0:09:32.0 S1: excited

0:09:32.5 S1: to

0:09:32.7 S1: take

0:09:32.9 S1: the

0:09:33.1 S1: people

0:09:33.4 S1: and

0:09:33.6 S1: have

0:09:33.7 S1: them

0:09:33.9 S1: on

0:09:34.1 S1: the

0:09:34.3 S1: talk

0:09:34.6 S1: show

0:09:35.4 S1: when

0:09:35.5 S1: they

0:09:35.7 S1: forgot

0:09:36.3 S1: that

0:09:36.4 S1: it

0:09:36.5 S1: was

0:09:38.0 S1: part

0:09:38.3 S1: of

0:09:38.5 S1: the

0:09:39.2 S1: intergalactic

0:09:40.1 S1: law

0:09:40.5 S1: that

0:09:40.8 S1: you

0:09:41.0 S1: can't

0:09:41.3 S1: just

0:09:42.2 S1: take

0:09:42.6 S1: people

0:09:42.9 S1: into

0:09:43.3 S1: different

0:09:43.7 S1: galaxies

0:09:44.5 S1: and

0:09:44.8 S1: stuff

0:09:45.2 S1: without

0:09:46.0 S1: going

0:09:46.0 S1: through

0:09:46.3 S1: security

0:09:46.9 S1: check.

0:09:47.3 S1: So

0:09:47.6 S1: the

0:09:48.6 S1: Nardu

0:09:49.2 S1: news

0:09:49.7 S1: caught

0:09:50.4 S1: footage

0:09:51.2 S1: of

0:09:51.5 S1: them

0:09:52.0 S1: blasting

0:09:52.9 S1: into

0:09:53.4 S1: Nardu

0:09:54.0 S1: and

0:09:54.3 S1: it

0:09:54.5 S1: was

0:09:54.8 S1: starting

0:09:55.5 S1: to

0:09:55.8 S1: become

0:09:56.1 S1: a

0:09:56.2 S1: little

0:09:56.2 S1: bit

0:09:56.4 S1: of

0:09:56.5 S1: a

0:09:56.7 S1: scandal.

0:10:00.7 S2: Yes,

0:10:01.1 S2: and

0:10:01.3 S2: then

0:10:01.5 S2: it

0:10:01.7 S2: reached

0:10:02.3 S2: the

0:10:02.6 S2: political

0:10:03.3 S2: offices

0:10:04.3 S2: of

0:10:05.3 S2: both

0:10:07.8 S2: the

0:10:08.1 S2: Nardu

0:10:10.3 S2: planet

0:10:12.4 S2: as

0:10:12.7 S2: well

0:10:12.9 S2: as

0:10:14.6 S2: the

0:10:16.2 S2: Earth

0:10:17.7 S2: planet,

0:10:19.2 S2: and

0:10:19.5 S2: decided

0:10:21.1 S2: to

0:10:21.3 S2: go

0:10:21.5 S2: to

0:10:21.7 S2: negotiations

0:10:22.7 S2: about

0:10:22.9 S2: how

0:10:23.1 S2: to

0:10:23.3 S2: handle

0:10:23.6 S2: the

0:10:23.7 S2: conflict.

0:10:27.0 S2: It's

0:10:27.4 S2: being

0:10:27.7 S2: tense

0:10:28.1 S2: at

0:10:28.3 S2: first.

0:10:29.5 S1: And

0:10:30.3 S1: so

0:10:33.8 S1: the

0:10:34.7 S1: talk

0:10:35.1 S1: show,

0:10:38.2 S1: Nardu

0:10:38.9 S1: now

0:10:40.7 S1: was

0:10:41.1 S1: projected

0:10:41.6 S1: to

0:10:41.7 S1: have

0:10:41.9 S1: the

0:10:42.0 S1: highest

0:10:42.5 S1: ratings

0:10:43.0 S1: of

0:10:43.2 S1: all

0:10:43.6 S1: time,

0:10:44.9 S1: and

0:10:45.7 S1: the

0:10:45.9 S1: aliens

0:10:46.3 S1: were

0:10:46.5 S1: really,

0:10:46.8 S1: really

0:10:47.0 S1: excited

0:10:48.1 S1: and

0:10:48.3 S1: they

0:10:48.6 S1: kept

0:10:50.1 S1: trying

0:10:50.3 S1: to

0:10:50.5 S1: get

0:10:50.6 S1: the

0:10:50.8 S1: humans

0:10:51.2 S1: more

0:10:51.5 S1: and

0:10:51.7 S1: more

0:10:52.0 S1: upset

0:10:52.4 S1: with

0:10:52.7 S1: each

0:10:52.9 S1: other

0:10:53.2 S1: so

0:10:53.4 S1: that

0:10:53.5 S1: they'll

0:10:53.8 S1: be

0:10:53.9 S1: really

0:10:54.2 S1: exciting

0:10:54.7 S1: to

0:10:54.9 S1: watch

0:10:55.2 S1: on

0:10:55.4 S1: the

0:10:55.6 S1: show.

0:10:55.9 S1: And

0:10:56.0 S1: they

0:10:56.2 S1: kept

0:10:56.4 S1: asking

0:10:56.9 S1: about

0:10:57.7 S1: the

0:10:57.9 S1: job

0:10:58.3 S1: application

0:11:01.9 S1: and

0:11:02.3 S1: also

0:11:02.9 S1: whether

0:11:03.2 S1: or

0:11:03.4 S1: not...

0:11:03.7 S1: Is

0:11:03.8 S1: the

0:11:04.8 S1: job

0:11:05.7 S1: is

0:11:06.5 S1: more

0:11:07.4 S1: important

0:11:09.4 S1: or

0:11:09.6 S1: the

0:11:09.8 S1: relationship

0:11:10.2 S1: was

0:11:10.3 S1: more

0:11:10.5 S1: important.

0:11:12.5 S1: To

0:11:12.6 S1: make

0:11:13.0 S1: matters

0:11:13.7 S1: worse,

0:11:15.4 S1: the

0:11:15.6 S1: woman

0:11:15.9 S1: was

0:11:16.3 S1: pregnant

0:11:17.1 S1: but

0:11:17.3 S1: she

0:11:17.4 S1: was

0:11:17.7 S1: hiding

0:11:18.1 S1: it

0:11:18.4 S1: from

0:11:19.1 S1: the

0:11:19.2 S1: man.

0:11:20.9 S1: So

0:11:21.1 S1: they

0:11:21.2 S1: thought

0:11:22.3 S1: that

0:11:23.0 S1: it'd

0:11:23.7 S1: be

0:11:24.0 S1: cool

0:11:24.3 S1: to

0:11:24.5 S1: reveal

0:11:24.8 S1: that

0:11:25.1 S1: on

0:11:25.2 S1: the

0:11:25.4 S1: show,

0:11:25.8 S1: but

0:11:26.0 S1: they

0:11:26.9 S1: also

0:11:27.3 S1: were

0:11:27.8 S1: aware

0:11:28.0 S1: of

0:11:28.1 S1: the

0:11:28.6 S1: political

0:11:29.0 S1: tension.

0:11:31.3 S1: And

0:11:31.7 S1: first

0:11:32.2 S1: the

0:11:32.5 S1: aliens

0:11:33.7 S1: were

0:11:34.1 S1: skeptical,

0:11:34.6 S1: they

0:11:34.8 S1: were

0:11:35.0 S1: like,

0:11:36.9 S1: "Is

0:11:37.2 S1: talking

0:11:37.6 S1: about

0:11:37.8 S1: being

0:11:38.1 S1: pregnant

0:11:38.4 S1: on

0:11:38.5 S1: the

0:11:38.7 S1: show,

0:11:38.9 S1: is

0:11:39.1 S1: that

0:11:39.3 S1: really

0:11:39.6 S1: interesting,

0:11:40.5 S1: or

0:11:40.7 S1: should

0:11:40.9 S1: they

0:11:41.1 S1: say

0:11:41.2 S1: more

0:11:41.4 S1: about

0:11:41.5 S1: the

0:11:41.7 S1: job."

0:11:42.0 S1: And

0:11:42.2 S1: the

0:11:42.4 S1: humans

0:11:42.7 S1: were

0:11:42.8 S1: like,

0:11:43.1 S1: "no,

0:11:43.3 S1: no,

0:11:43.5 S1: you

0:11:43.6 S1: have

0:11:43.8 S1: no

0:11:44.1 S1: idea

0:11:44.6 S1: like

0:11:45.0 S1: on

0:11:45.3 S1: human

0:11:45.8 S1: reality

0:11:46.3 S1: television,

0:11:47.5 S1: people

0:11:47.8 S1: surprise

0:11:48.4 S1: people

0:11:48.7 S1: about

0:11:49.2 S1: being

0:11:49.5 S1: pregnant

0:11:49.8 S1: and

0:11:50.0 S1: having

0:11:50.3 S1: kids

0:11:50.5 S1: and

0:11:50.7 S1: stuff

0:11:50.9 S1: all

0:11:51.0 S1: the

0:11:51.2 S1: time,

0:11:52.0 S1: and

0:11:52.2 S1: it's

0:11:52.4 S1: really

0:11:52.7 S1: popular [laughter]

0:11:53.5 S1: and

0:11:53.9 S1: paternity

0:11:55.1 S1: test

0:11:55.5 S1: and

0:11:55.7 S1: all

0:11:55.8 S1: these

0:11:56.1 S1: stuff

0:11:56.4 S1: so

0:11:56.9 S1: you

0:11:57.0 S1: should

0:11:57.3 S1: definitely

0:11:57.8 S1: put

0:11:57.9 S1: it

0:11:58.0 S1: on

0:11:58.2 S1: the

0:11:58.2 S1: show."

0:11:58.2 S1: The

0:11:58.3 S1: girl

0:11:58.3 S1: told

0:11:58.3 S1: them,

0:11:58.4 S1: "You

0:11:58.4 S1: should

0:11:58.5 S1: definitely

0:11:58.6 S1: put

0:11:58.6 S1: it

0:11:58.6 S1: on

0:11:58.6 S1: the

0:12:02.0 S1: show."

0:12:02.7 S2: The

0:12:02.8 S2: humans

0:12:03.1 S2: were

0:12:03.4 S2: quite

0:12:03.8 S2: surprised

0:12:05.6 S2: that

0:12:06.2 S2: the

0:12:07.1 S2: aliens

0:12:07.5 S2: didn't

0:12:07.8 S2: think

0:12:07.9 S2: their

0:12:08.1 S2: audience

0:12:08.7 S2: would

0:12:08.9 S2: be

0:12:09.2 S2: interested

0:12:09.6 S2: by

0:12:09.8 S2: it

0:12:10.1 S2: because

0:12:10.6 S2: obviously,

0:12:11.0 S2: it's

0:12:11.4 S2: very

0:12:11.8 S2: popular

0:12:12.3 S2: on

0:12:12.5 S2: earth.

0:12:13.9 S2: But

0:12:14.1 S2: they

0:12:14.2 S2: were

0:12:14.3 S2: able

0:12:14.5 S2: to

0:12:15.1 S2: convince

0:12:15.8 S2: the

0:12:15.9 S2: aliens

0:12:17.8 S2: to

0:12:19.1 S2: go

0:12:19.3 S2: that

0:12:19.5 S2: way.

0:12:21.3 S2: But

0:12:21.5 S2: obviously,

0:12:23.4 S2: the

0:12:23.5 S2: people

0:12:23.7 S2: on

0:12:23.8 S2: the

0:12:23.9 S2: conflict

0:12:24.5 S2: who

0:12:25.1 S2: didnt

0:12:26.0 S2: know

0:12:26.1 S2: about

0:12:26.4 S2: this,

0:12:26.8 S2: the

0:12:27.0 S2: other

0:12:28.0 S2: human

0:12:28.4 S2: being

0:12:28.6 S2: knew

0:12:28.8 S2: about

0:12:29.0 S2: it.

0:12:31.4 S1: So

0:12:31.5 S1: but

0:12:31.6 S1: the

0:12:31.7 S1: girl

0:12:31.9 S1: was

0:12:32.1 S1: like,

0:12:32.3 S1: "Yeah,

0:12:32.5 S1: we

0:12:32.7 S1: should

0:12:32.8 S1: talk

0:12:32.9 S1: about

0:12:33.0 S1: I

0:12:33.0 S1: that

0:12:33.1 S1: on

0:12:33.3 S1: the

0:12:33.4 S1: show."

0:12:34.2 S1: They're

0:12:34.4 S1: like,

0:12:34.6 S1: "alright,

0:12:34.9 S1: let's

0:12:35.1 S1: do

0:12:35.3 S1: it."

0:12:35.8 S1: And

0:12:36.0 S1: then

0:12:37.1 S1: so

0:12:37.2 S1: then

0:12:37.3 S1: the

0:12:37.5 S1: Nardu

0:12:38.1 S1: Police

0:12:38.6 S1: Department

0:12:39.5 S1: was

0:12:39.7 S1: looking

0:12:40.0 S1: around

0:12:40.3 S1: for

0:12:40.4 S1: the

0:12:40.6 S1: humans.

0:12:41.5 S1: So

0:12:41.7 S1: it's

0:12:41.9 S1: like,

0:12:42.0 S1: it's

0:12:42.2 S1: really

0:12:42.4 S1: tense

0:12:42.7 S1: couple

0:12:43.1 S1: days

0:12:43.3 S1: before

0:12:43.6 S1: the

0:12:43.8 S1: show.

0:12:44.1 S1: It's

0:12:44.3 S1: like

0:12:44.6 S1: everyone

0:12:45.1 S1: was

0:12:45.4 S1: worked

0:12:45.7 S1: up

0:12:45.9 S1: on

0:12:46.1 S1: the

0:12:46.3 S1: space

0:12:46.6 S1: ship

0:12:46.8 S1: and

0:12:47.0 S1: getting

0:12:47.3 S1: ready

0:12:47.5 S1: for

0:12:47.6 S1: the

0:12:47.8 S1: show

0:12:49.4 S1: and

0:12:49.6 S1: building

0:12:49.6 S1: tension.

0:12:49.6 S1: But

0:12:49.6 S1: then

0:12:49.7 S1: they

0:12:49.8 S1: were

0:12:50.0 S1: also

0:12:50.3 S1: kind

0:12:50.5 S1: of

0:12:50.9 S1: hiding

0:12:51.3 S1: out,

0:12:51.7 S1: and

0:12:51.9 S1: trying

0:12:52.6 S1: not

0:12:52.7 S1: to

0:12:52.8 S1: get

0:12:52.9 S1: caught

0:12:53.2 S1: by

0:12:53.3 S1: the

0:12:53.5 S1: cops

0:12:53.9 S1: before

0:12:54.2 S1: the

0:12:54.4 S1: show

0:12:54.8 S1: aired

0:12:55.4 S1: on

0:12:55.8 S1: TV

0:12:56.0 S1: and

0:12:56.3 S1: stuff

0:12:56.5 S1: and

0:12:56.7 S1: they

0:12:56.8 S1: were

0:12:58.2 S1: all

0:13:00.2 S1: gearing

0:13:04.2 S1: up

0:13:05.7 S1: for

0:13:07.2 S1: the

0:13:07.5 S1: big

0:13:07.9 S1: day.

0:13:00.9 S2: It

0:13:08.0 S2: seemed

0:13:08.0 S2: like

0:13:08.1 S2: an

0:13:08.1 S2: impossible

0:13:08.3 S2: situation

0:13:08.4 S2: but

0:13:08.5 S2: the

0:13:08.6 S2: broadcast

0:13:09.1 S2: finally

0:13:09.4 S2: arrived

0:13:10.2 S2: and

0:13:11.7 S2: it

0:13:11.9 S2: seemed

0:13:12.0 S2: like

0:13:12.2 S2: they

0:13:12.3 S2: were

0:13:12.4 S2: gonna

0:13:12.6 S2: get

0:13:12.7 S2: away

0:13:13.0 S2: with

0:13:13.1 S2: it.

0:13:13.4 S2: They

0:13:14.2 S2: were

0:13:14.9 S2: about

0:13:15.2 S2: to

0:13:15.9 S2: go

0:13:16.1 S2: on

0:13:16.3 S2: the

0:13:16.6 S2: air,

0:13:18.8 S2: but

0:13:19.1 S2: then

0:13:20.0 S2: the

0:13:20.2 S2: human

0:13:20.7 S2: started

0:13:21.4 S2: to

0:13:22.3 S2: get

0:13:22.6 S2: sick.

0:13:23.2 S2: Guess

0:13:23.8 S2: they

0:13:24.0 S2: weren't

0:13:24.2 S2: used

0:13:24.4 S2: to

0:13:24.5 S2: the

0:13:24.6 S2: atmosphere

0:13:26.5 S2: on

0:13:26.7 S2: the

0:13:26.8 S2: other

0:13:27.0 S2: planet.

0:13:30.1 S1: And

0:13:31.6 S1: because

0:13:32.0 S1: the

0:13:32.1 S1: woman...

0:13:32.4 S1: Both

0:13:32.6 S1: of

0:13:32.7 S1: them

0:13:32.9 S1: started

0:13:33.1 S1: having

0:13:33.5 S1: convulsions

0:13:34.6 S1: and

0:13:34.7 S1: their

0:13:34.9 S1: muscles

0:13:35.5 S1: started

0:13:35.8 S1: contracting,

0:13:37.1 S1: and

0:13:37.3 S1: it

0:13:37.5 S1: caused

0:13:37.8 S1: the

0:13:38.0 S1: woman

0:13:38.4 S1: to

0:13:38.7 S1: go

0:13:38.9 S1: into

0:13:39.3 S1: labor

0:13:41.4 S1: right

0:13:41.7 S1: when

0:13:41.8 S1: the

0:13:42.0 S1: cameras

0:13:42.7 S1: turned

0:13:43.2 S1: on.

0:13:44.0 S1: So

0:13:44.3 S1: everyone

0:13:44.8 S1: was

0:13:45.0 S1: tuned

0:13:45.4 S1: in

0:13:45.6 S1: to

0:13:45.7 S1: watch

0:13:46.1 S1: the

0:13:46.3 S1: show,

0:13:48.2 S1: and

0:13:48.4 S1: then

0:13:48.7 S1: it

0:13:48.9 S1: turned

0:13:49.2 S1: out

0:13:49.4 S1: the

0:13:49.6 S1: woman

0:13:49.9 S1: was

0:13:50.0 S1: about

0:13:50.6 S1: to

0:13:50.9 S1: have

0:13:51.4 S1: the

0:13:51.6 S1: first

0:13:52.0 S1: human

0:13:52.7 S1: born

0:13:53.4 S1: on

0:13:53.6 S1: the

0:13:53.8 S1: planet

0:13:54.2 S1: of

0:13:54.5 S1: Nardu.

0:13:55.8 S1: So

0:13:56.0 S1: that

0:13:56.2 S1: was

0:13:56.3 S1: a

0:13:56.5 S1: pretty

0:13:58.2 S1: big

0:13:59.2 S1: deal

0:14:00.4 S1: and

0:14:01.2 S1: the

0:14:01.4 S1: fact

0:14:01.6 S1: that

0:14:01.8 S1: there

0:14:02.0 S1: was

0:14:02.1 S1: a

0:14:02.3 S1: first

0:14:02.6 S1: human

0:14:03.8 S1: born

0:14:04.8 S1: on

0:14:05.4 S1: Nardu

0:14:06.3 S1: really

0:14:07.0 S1: changed

0:14:07.5 S1: things.

0:14:09.1 S1: It

0:14:09.3 S1: was

0:14:09.4 S1: a

0:14:09.5 S1: great

0:14:09.7 S1: accomplishment

0:14:11.0 S1: for

0:14:11.7 S1: both

0:14:13.6 S1: planets

0:14:15.8 S1: and

0:14:16.0 S1: so

0:14:16.3 S1: everyone

0:14:16.8 S1: was

0:14:18.6 S1: deemed

0:14:19.0 S1: a

0:14:19.2 S1: hero

0:14:19.7 S1: for

0:14:20.1 S1: making

this [0:14:20.9] ____

0:14:21.4 S1: specie

0:14:23.3 S1: relationship

0:14:23.8 S1: possible,

0:14:26.1 S1: both

0:14:26.7 S1: political

0:14:27.4 S1: states

0:14:27.9 S1: were

0:14:28.1 S1: happy.

0:14:29.6 S1: Right.

0:14:30.0 S1: So

0:14:30.4 S1: everyone

0:14:31.2 S1: decided

0:14:31.6 S1: to

0:14:31.8 S1: just

0:14:32.0 S1: let

0:14:32.1 S1: all

0:14:32.3 S1: the

0:14:32.4 S1: legal

0:14:32.8 S1: stuff

0:14:33.1 S1: go

0:14:33.2 S1: 'cause

0:14:33.4 S1: they

0:14:33.5 S1: were

0:14:33.7 S1: so

0:14:33.9 S1: excited

0:14:34.3 S1: about

0:14:34.6 S1: this

0:14:34.8 S1: first

0:14:35.3 S1: human

0:14:35.7 S1: born

0:14:35.9 S1: on

0:14:36.2 S1: Nardu

0:14:37.2 S1: and

0:14:38.4 S1: they

0:14:38.6 S1: interviewed

0:14:39.0 S1: the

0:14:39.2 S1: parents

0:14:39.6 S1: and

0:14:39.7 S1: the

0:14:39.9 S1: dad

0:14:40.1 S1: was

0:14:40.3 S1: like,

0:14:40.5 S1: "Yeah,

0:14:40.7 S1: I

0:14:40.9 S1: can't

0:14:41.2 S1: believe

0:14:41.4 S1: I

0:14:41.5 S1: didn't

0:14:41.8 S1: know

0:14:42.0 S1: she

0:14:42.1 S1: was

0:14:42.3 S1: nine

0:14:42.5 S1: months

0:14:42.8 S1: pregnant.

0:14:43.2 S1: I

0:14:43.3 S1: guess

0:14:43.4 S1: she

0:14:43.6 S1: wore

0:14:43.8 S1: a

0:14:43.9 S1: lot

0:14:44.0 S1: of

0:14:44.1 S1: down

0:14:44.5 S1: jackets

0:14:45.0 S1: all

0:14:45.2 S1: winter [laughter]

0:14:47.4 S1: and

0:14:47.6 S1: then

0:14:49.2 S1: they

0:14:49.3 S1: decided

0:14:49.9 S1: to

0:14:50.0 S1: raise

0:14:50.3 S1: the

0:14:50.6 S1: kid

0:14:50.8 S1: half

0:14:50.9 S1: of

0:14:51.0 S1: the

0:14:51.2 S1: time

0:14:51.4 S1: on

0:14:51.5 S1: earth

0:14:51.8 S1: and

0:14:52.0 S1: half

0:14:52.2 S1: of

0:14:52.3 S1: the

0:14:52.4 S1: time

0:14:52.6 S1: on

0:14:52.8 S1: Nardu

0:14:53.1 S1: and

0:14:53.3 S1: it

0:14:53.4 S1: was

0:14:53.6 S1: gonna

0:14:53.7 S1: be

0:14:53.8 S1: the

0:14:54.0 S1: first

0:14:54.4 S1: intergalactic

0:14:55.3 S1: political

0:14:56.4 S1: representative.
