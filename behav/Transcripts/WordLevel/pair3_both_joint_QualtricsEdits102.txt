0:00:00.0 S1: Alright,

0:00:00.3 S1: first

0:00:00.5 S1: my

0:00:00.6 S1: turn.

0:00:00.8 S1: It

0:00:00.9 S1: started

0:00:04.3 S1: out

0:00:05.6 S1: a

0:00:05.6 S1: normal

0:00:06.1 S1: day

0:00:07.8 S1: but

0:00:09.2 S1: Sally

0:00:09.3 S1: was

0:00:10.1 S1: really

0:00:11.0 S1: tired

0:00:11.8 S1: from

0:00:12.5 S1: going

0:00:13.3 S1: to

0:00:13.7 S1: school

0:00:14.6 S1: she

0:00:15.2 S1: was

0:00:15.7 S1: on

0:00:16.0 S1: the

0:00:16.1 S1: playground.

0:00:18.5 S1: She'd

0:00:19.8 S1: been

0:00:20.8 S1: trying

0:00:22.2 S1: to

0:00:22.4 S1: climb

0:00:23.2 S1: the

0:00:23.7 S1: monkey

0:00:24.6 S1: bar

0:00:25.2 S1: but

0:00:25.7 S1: hadn't

0:00:26.6 S1: quite

0:00:27.4 S1: managed

to [0:00:24.2] ____

0:00:28.4 S1: her

0:00:28.5 S1: elbow.

0:00:28.5 S1: So

0:00:28.5 S1: she

0:00:28.6 S1: was

0:00:28.6 S1: in

0:00:28.6 S1: a

0:00:28.7 S1: bad

0:00:28.7 S1: mood

0:00:28.7 S1: when

0:00:28.8 S1: she

0:00:28.8 S1: came

0:00:28.9 S1: home

0:00:28.9 S1: from

0:00:29.1 S1: school

0:00:30.2 S1: that

0:00:31.0 S1: day.

0:00:31.3 S2: Her

0:00:32.3 S2: mom

0:00:32.9 S2: offered

0:00:34.0 S2: to

0:00:34.1 S2: make

0:00:34.6 S2: her

0:00:35.0 S2: a

0:00:35.2 S2: snack

0:00:35.6 S2: but

0:00:35.9 S2: she

0:00:36.1 S2: said,

0:00:37.3 S2: "No

0:00:37.5 S2: mom,

0:00:37.9 S2: I'm

0:00:38.1 S2: too

0:00:38.4 S2: upset

0:00:38.7 S2: to

0:00:38.8 S2: eat

0:00:39.0 S2: right

0:00:39.1 S2: now,"

0:00:39.8 S2: and

0:00:40.2 S2: stormed

0:00:40.7 S2: into

0:00:41.0 S2: her

0:00:41.1 S2: room

0:00:42.6 S2: where

0:00:42.9 S2: she

0:00:44.2 S2: began

0:00:45.6 S2: figuring

0:00:46.0 S2: out

0:00:46.3 S2: a

0:00:46.5 S2: way

0:00:47.3 S2: to

0:00:48.1 S2: get

0:00:48.4 S2: strong

0:00:48.9 S2: to

0:00:49.1 S2: be

0:00:49.2 S2: able

0:00:49.4 S2: to

0:00:49.5 S2: do

0:00:50.6 S2: the

0:00:50.9 S2: monkey

0:00:51.9 S2: bars.

0:00:52.6 S2: She

0:00:53.2 S2: searched

0:00:54.4 S2: for

0:00:55.0 S2: workout

0:00:55.3 S2: routines

0:00:55.9 S2: for

0:01:01.6 S2: monkey

0:01:04.6 S2: bar

pulling. 0:01:04.6 S1:  [chuckle]

0:01:04.6 S1: The

0:01:04.6 S1: internet

0:01:05.6 S1: wasn't

0:01:06.1 S1: really

0:01:06.4 S1: helpful

0:01:06.8 S1: for

0:01:07.0 S1: that.

0:01:08.6 S1: Luckily,

0:01:09.0 S1: she

0:01:09.2 S1: had

0:01:09.3 S1: an

0:01:09.5 S1: older

0:01:09.9 S1: brother

0:01:11.3 S1: and

0:01:11.7 S1: so

0:01:11.9 S1: she

0:01:12.1 S1: thought,

0:01:12.2 S1: "Okay,

0:01:12.6 S1: I'll

0:01:13.0 S1: go

0:01:13.2 S1: ask

0:01:13.4 S1: him

0:01:14.1 S1: how

0:01:14.3 S1: do

0:01:15.8 S1: I

0:01:16.0 S1: conquer

0:01:16.4 S1: the

0:01:16.6 S1: monkey

0:01:17.0 S1: bars?"

0:01:18.3 S1: And

0:01:20.1 S1: she

0:01:20.2 S1: went

0:01:20.4 S1: to

0:01:20.5 S1: older

0:01:20.8 S1: brother,

0:01:21.3 S1: named

0:01:22.0 S1: Sam,

0:01:22.1 S1: and

0:01:22.3 S1: she

0:01:22.5 S1: knocked

0:01:22.8 S1: on

0:01:23.0 S1: his

0:01:23.1 S1: door

0:01:23.3 S1: but

0:01:23.7 S1: he

0:01:27.2 S1: said,

0:01:27.4 S1: "Go

0:01:27.6 S1: away,"

0:01:28.6 S1: which

0:01:29.5 S1: just

0:01:30.3 S1: made

0:01:31.0 S1: Sally

0:01:31.9 S1: pretty

0:01:32.9 S1: sad.

0:01:33.3 S2: After

0:01:34.0 S2: being

0:01:34.2 S2: told

0:01:34.4 S2: to

0:01:34.5 S2: go

0:01:34.6 S2: away,

0:01:35.0 S2: Sally

0:01:35.7 S2: said,

0:01:36.7 S2: "But

0:01:36.9 S2: I

0:01:37.0 S2: wanna

0:01:37.3 S2: get

0:01:37.5 S2: strong

0:01:37.9 S2: like

0:01:38.1 S2: you

0:01:38.4 S2: and

0:01:38.5 S2: so

0:01:38.7 S2: that

0:01:38.8 S2: I

0:01:38.9 S2: can

0:01:39.0 S2: climb

0:01:39.5 S2: the

0:01:39.7 S2: monkey

0:01:40.2 S2: bars."

0:01:40.5 S2: And

0:01:40.7 S2: her

0:01:40.9 S2: brother

0:01:41.2 S2: said,

0:01:42.1 S2: "The

0:01:42.3 S2: best

0:01:42.6 S2: way

0:01:42.9 S2: to

0:01:43.1 S2: get

0:01:43.3 S2: strong

0:01:44.0 S2: is

0:01:44.4 S2: by

0:01:44.6 S2: picking

0:01:45.3 S2: fights

0:01:45.8 S2: with

0:01:45.9 S2: other

0:01:46.3 S2: school

0:01:46.6 S2: children."

0:01:48.1 S2: Her

0:01:48.3 S2: brother

0:01:48.7 S2: has

0:01:48.8 S2: had

0:01:49.2 S2: a

0:01:49.4 S2: record

0:01:49.8 S2: of

0:01:50.7 S2: being

0:01:50.9 S2: a

0:01:51.0 S2: bit

0:01:51.2 S2: of

0:01:51.3 S2: an

0:01:51.5 S2: upstart

0:01:52.1 S2: and

0:01:53.6 S2: a

0:01:53.6 S2: little

0:01:53.9 S2: bit

0:01:54.1 S2: difficult

0:01:54.6 S2: to

0:01:54.9 S2: get

0:01:55.1 S2: along

0:01:55.4 S2: with

0:01:56.8 S2: and

0:01:56.9 S2: this

0:01:57.2 S2: was

0:01:57.4 S2: the

0:01:57.5 S2: beginning

0:01:57.9 S2: of

0:02:01.5 S2: Sally's

0:02:05.0 S2: turn

0:02:05.0 S2: toward

0:02:05.0 S2: doing

0:02:05.1 S2: this.

0:02:05.1 S1: So

0:02:05.1 S1: Sally

0:02:05.1 S1: was

0:02:05.1 S1: a

0:02:05.2 S1: bit

0:02:05.5 S1: confused.

0:02:06.3 S1: She

0:02:06.5 S1: had

0:02:06.7 S1: been

0:02:06.9 S1: the

0:02:07.0 S1: good

0:02:07.2 S1: child

0:02:07.4 S1: in

0:02:07.6 S1: the

0:02:07.7 S1: family

0:02:08.8 S1: but

0:02:09.2 S1: she

0:02:09.4 S1: really

0:02:09.6 S1: wanted

0:02:09.9 S1: to

0:02:10.0 S1: conquer

0:02:10.5 S1: the

0:02:10.7 S1: monkey

0:02:11.2 S1: bars.

0:02:11.4 S1: So

0:02:11.5 S1: she

0:02:11.8 S1: started

0:02:12.2 S1: planning

0:02:14.8 S1: how

0:02:15.2 S1: she

0:02:15.4 S1: would

0:02:17.8 S1: get

0:02:18.1 S1: into

0:02:18.5 S1: fights

0:02:18.9 S1: on

0:02:19.2 S1: the

0:02:19.4 S1: school

0:02:19.9 S1: yard

0:02:20.2 S1: in

0:02:20.3 S1: order

0:02:20.6 S1: to

0:02:20.7 S1: conquer

0:02:21.0 S1: the

0:02:21.2 S1: monkey

0:02:21.6 S1: bars.

0:02:23.6 S1: That

0:02:23.9 S1: night

0:02:24.8 S1: she

0:02:25.8 S1: didn't

0:02:26.1 S1: get

0:02:26.2 S1: much

0:02:26.5 S1: sleep,

0:02:26.7 S1: thinking

0:02:27.0 S1: about

0:02:27.3 S1: them.

0:02:27.7 S1: Eventually

0:02:28.2 S1: fell

0:02:28.7 S1: asleep

0:02:29.3 S1: and

0:02:29.3 S1: ready

0:02:29.5 S1: for

0:02:29.7 S1: the

0:02:29.8 S1: day

0:02:30.0 S1: at

0:02:30.7 S1: school.

0:02:32.1 S2: The

0:02:32.3 S2: next

0:02:32.6 S2: morning

0:02:33.0 S2: her

0:02:33.2 S2: brother

0:02:33.5 S2: woke

0:02:33.9 S2: her

0:02:34.2 S2: up

0:02:34.5 S2: at

0:02:34.7 S2: 5:00

0:02:35.1 S2: AM

0:02:35.3 S2: and

0:02:35.6 S2: said,

0:02:36.0 S2: "Sally,

0:02:36.5 S2: we're

0:02:36.7 S2: gonna

0:02:36.8 S2: lift

0:02:37.0 S2: some

0:02:37.2 S2: weights."

0:02:38.8 S2: So

0:02:38.9 S2: he

0:02:39.0 S2: brought

0:02:39.4 S2: Sally

0:02:39.7 S2: down

0:02:39.9 S2: to

0:02:40.1 S2: the

0:02:40.1 S2: garage

0:02:41.1 S2: and

0:02:41.5 S2: showed

0:02:41.8 S2: her

0:02:42.4 S2: how

0:02:42.7 S2: to

0:02:43.3 S2: do

0:02:43.6 S2: bicep

0:02:44.0 S2: curls

0:02:45.1 S2: and

0:02:46.4 S2: squats

0:02:47.0 S2: and

0:02:47.3 S2: deadlifts

0:02:48.3 S2: and

0:02:48.5 S2: in

0:02:48.7 S2: general,

0:02:49.7 S2: how

0:02:49.9 S2: to

0:02:50.1 S2: get

0:02:50.3 S2: strong

0:02:51.4 S2: for

0:02:51.9 S2: her

0:02:52.2 S2: days

0:02:52.5 S2: of

0:02:52.7 S2: fighting

0:02:53.2 S2: and

0:02:53.6 S2: monkey

0:02:54.2 S2: bar

0:02:54.5 S2: climbing

0:02:55.2 S2: ahead.

0:02:57.1 S2: Sally

0:02:57.6 S2: was

0:02:57.8 S2: a

0:02:57.9 S2: natural

0:02:58.5 S2: and

0:02:59.1 S2: was

0:02:59.2 S2: soon

0:02:59.5 S2: lifting

0:02:60.0 S2: lots

0:03:00.2 S2: of

0:03:01.5 S2: weight.

0:03:04.5 S1: So

0:03:04.5 S1: Sally's

0:03:04.5 S1: parents

0:03:04.9 S1: thought

0:03:05.1 S1: it

0:03:05.1 S1: was

0:03:05.3 S1: weird

0:03:05.7 S1: that

0:03:05.8 S1: they

0:03:06.0 S1: were

0:03:06.1 S1: getting

0:03:06.4 S1: up

0:03:06.6 S1: so

0:03:07.3 S1: early,

0:03:08.4 S1: Sally

0:03:08.8 S1: and

0:03:08.9 S1: her

0:03:09.0 S1: brother,

0:03:11.1 S1: but

0:03:11.3 S1: that

0:03:11.5 S1: it

0:03:11.5 S1: was

0:03:11.7 S1: good

0:03:12.6 S1: sibling

0:03:13.0 S1: bonding.

0:03:14.3 S1: So

0:03:15.1 S1: they

0:03:15.6 S1: kind

0:03:15.8 S1: of

0:03:15.9 S1: ignored

0:03:16.5 S1: the

0:03:18.0 S1: purpose

0:03:20.8 S1: of

0:03:20.9 S1: the

0:03:21.2 S1: weightlifting

0:03:22.1 S1: and

0:03:22.6 S1: getting

0:03:23.0 S1: stronger.

0:03:23.7 S1: They

0:03:23.8 S1: were

0:03:23.9 S1: just

0:03:24.1 S1: excited

0:03:24.5 S1: to

0:03:24.7 S1: see

0:03:24.8 S1: the

0:03:24.9 S1: siblings

0:03:25.3 S1: playing

0:03:25.6 S1: together.

0:03:28.3 S1: Sally

0:03:28.5 S1: quickly

0:03:28.7 S1: became

0:03:29.2 S1: very

0:03:29.5 S1: very

0:03:29.8 S1: strong

0:03:30.1 S1: with

0:03:30.3 S1: the

0:03:30.3 S1: lifting

0:03:30.6 S1: of

0:03:30.7 S1: the

0:03:30.8 S1: weights.

0:03:32.4 S2: Yep.

0:03:33.2 S2: So

0:03:33.7 S2: Sally

0:03:34.9 S2: decided

0:03:36.3 S2: that

0:03:36.5 S2: she

0:03:36.7 S2: would

0:03:36.9 S2: get

0:03:37.1 S2: on

0:03:37.3 S2: an

0:03:37.5 S2: eight-

0:03:37.8 S2: week

0:03:37.9 S2: training

0:03:38.2 S2: program

0:03:38.9 S2: and

0:03:39.1 S2: then

0:03:40.6 S2: go

0:03:40.8 S2: back

0:03:40.9 S2: to

0:03:41.1 S2: the

0:03:41.2 S2: monkey

0:03:41.7 S2: bars.

0:03:42.3 S2: So

0:03:42.5 S2: after

0:03:42.9 S2: lots

0:03:43.2 S2: of

0:03:43.3 S2: morning

0:03:43.7 S2: sessions

0:03:44.1 S2: with

0:03:44.2 S2: her

0:03:44.4 S2: brother

0:03:45.2 S2: and

0:03:45.6 S2: a

0:03:45.8 S2: few

0:03:46.1 S2: protein

0:03:46.5 S2: shakes,

0:03:48.1 S2: she

0:03:48.8 S2: was

0:03:49.0 S2: much

0:03:49.2 S2: stronger

0:03:49.7 S2: and

0:03:49.9 S2: decided

0:03:50.9 S2: to

0:03:51.3 S2: go

0:03:51.5 S2: back

0:03:51.7 S2: to

0:03:51.8 S2: the

0:03:52.0 S2: monkey

0:03:52.7 S2: bars.

0:03:53.6 S2: She

0:03:53.8 S2: climbed

0:03:54.8 S2: up

0:03:55.1 S2: and

0:03:55.3 S2: put

0:03:55.3 S2: her

0:03:55.3 S2: hand

0:03:55.3 S2: on

0:03:55.4 S2: the

0:03:55.5 S2: first

0:03:55.8 S2: bar

0:03:56.1 S2: determined

0:03:56.8 S2: to

0:03:57.0 S2: get

0:03:57.1 S2: across

0:03:57.4 S2: this

0:03:57.8 S2: time.

0:04:01.4 S2: So

0:04:01.7 S2: she

0:04:02.4 S2: had

0:04:03.2 S2: her

0:04:03.9 S2: hand

0:04:04.9 S2: on

0:04:05.2 S2: the

0:04:05.4 S2: first

0:04:05.6 S2: bar

0:04:06.1 S2: and

0:04:06.5 S2: was

0:04:06.8 S2: reaching,

0:04:07.4 S2: stretching

0:04:07.7 S2: to

0:04:07.8 S2: the

0:04:08.0 S2: second

0:04:08.3 S2: bar,

0:04:08.7 S2: made

0:04:09.3 S2: it.

0:04:09.6 S2: There

0:04:09.7 S2: were

0:04:09.8 S2: 12

0:04:10.2 S2: bars

0:04:10.5 S2: on

0:04:10.6 S2: this

0:04:11.1 S2: monkey

0:04:11.8 S2: bar

0:04:12.1 S2: routine

0:04:12.9 S2: and

0:04:13.3 S2: she

0:04:13.7 S2: made

0:04:14.1 S2: it

0:04:14.4 S2: halfway

0:04:15.2 S2: across.

0:04:15.8 S2: And

0:04:16.2 S2: so

0:04:16.5 S2: she

0:04:16.9 S2: was

0:04:17.3 S2: starting

0:04:18.1 S2: to

0:04:18.4 S2: lose

0:04:18.9 S2: confidence

0:04:19.8 S2: but

0:04:20.1 S2: she

0:04:20.3 S2: gritted

0:04:20.9 S2: her

0:04:21.2 S2: teeth

0:04:21.6 S2: and

0:04:21.9 S2: she

0:04:22.2 S2: made

0:04:22.6 S2: it

0:04:22.8 S2: a

0:04:23.0 S2: couple

0:04:23.5 S2: more

0:04:23.9 S2: bars

0:04:24.3 S2: and

0:04:24.6 S2: then

0:04:24.9 S2: fell

0:04:25.3 S2: down.

0:04:25.7 S2: She

0:04:26.0 S2: fell

0:04:26.4 S2: off

0:04:26.7 S2: the

0:04:27.0 S2: monkey

0:04:27.5 S2: bars.

0:04:27.9 S2: Tears

0:04:28.3 S2: streaming

0:04:29.1 S2: down

0:04:29.4 S2: her

0:04:29.7 S2: face;

0:04:30.1 S2: she

0:04:30.4 S2: couldn't

0:04:30.6 S2: do

0:04:30.8 S2: it.

0:04:32.1 S2: It

0:04:32.3 S2: was

0:04:32.5 S2: just

0:04:32.8 S2: then

0:04:33.0 S2: that

0:04:33.2 S2: the

0:04:33.3 S2: class

0:04:34.8 S2: bully,

0:04:35.3 S2: Johnny,

0:04:35.7 S2: came

0:04:36.2 S2: over

0:04:36.6 S2: and

0:04:36.8 S2: started

0:04:37.2 S2: making

0:04:38.7 S2: fun

0:04:39.4 S2: of

0:04:39.5 S2: Sally.

0:04:39.8 S2: He

0:04:39.9 S2: said,

0:04:40.1 S2: "Sally

0:04:40.4 S2: you

0:04:40.6 S2: are

0:04:40.7 S2: so

0:04:40.9 S2: weak.

0:04:41.1 S2: I

0:04:41.1 S2: can't

0:04:41.4 S2: believe

0:04:41.7 S2: you

0:04:41.8 S2: didn't

0:04:42.0 S2: make

0:04:42.2 S2: it

0:04:42.3 S2: across

0:04:42.6 S2: the

0:04:42.8 S2: monkey

0:04:43.8 S2: bars."

0:04:44.4 S2: This

0:04:44.6 S2: made

0:04:44.9 S2: Sally

0:04:45.2 S2: very

0:04:45.5 S2: mad

0:04:46.0 S2: and

0:04:46.4 S2: she

0:04:46.6 S2: started

0:04:47.1 S2: to

0:04:47.2 S2: get

0:04:47.4 S2: red

0:04:47.8 S2: and

0:04:48.1 S2: angry.

0:04:50.2 S2: She

0:04:50.5 S2: turned

0:04:50.9 S2: her

0:04:51.1 S2: sadness

0:04:52.7 S2: and

0:04:53.3 S2: her

0:04:53.5 S2: tears

0:04:54.2 S2: into

0:04:54.8 S2: anger

0:04:55.4 S2: and

0:04:55.7 S2: decided

0:04:56.2 S2: that

0:04:56.3 S2: today

0:04:56.5 S2: was

0:04:56.6 S2: the

0:04:56.6 S2: day

0:04:56.7 S2: to

0:04:56.9 S2: show

0:04:57.2 S2: Johnny

0:04:57.5 S2: a

0:04:57.6 S2: thing

0:04:57.9 S2: or

0:04:58.1 S2: two.

0:05:01.5 S1: Normally,

0:05:02.3 S1: she

0:05:02.4 S1: would

0:05:02.6 S1: have

0:05:02.8 S1: shown

0:05:03.1 S1: him

0:05:04.4 S1: with

0:05:04.6 S1: her

0:05:04.8 S1: word

0:05:05.6 S1: but

0:05:06.0 S1: the

0:05:06.8 S1: eight-

0:05:06.8 S1: week

0:05:06.8 S1: training

0:05:07.1 S1: program

0:05:08.4 S1: combined

0:05:08.8 S1: with

0:05:09.0 S1: the

0:05:09.1 S1: time

0:05:09.4 S1: spent

0:05:09.6 S1: with

0:05:09.8 S1: her

0:05:09.9 S1: brother

0:05:10.4 S1: had

0:05:11.5 S1: resulted

0:05:12.0 S1: in

0:05:13.8 S1: a

0:05:14.3 S1: very

0:05:14.7 S1: different

0:05:15.5 S1: motive.

0:05:16.1 S1: Sally

0:05:16.6 S1: had

0:05:16.8 S1: never

0:05:17.0 S1: been

0:05:17.2 S1: in

0:05:17.4 S1: a

0:05:17.5 S1: fight

0:05:17.7 S1: before

0:05:18.2 S1: so

0:05:18.4 S1: she

0:05:18.6 S1: wasn't

0:05:18.9 S1: quite

0:05:19.0 S1: sure

0:05:19.1 S1: what

0:05:19.4 S1: to

0:05:19.5 S1: do.

0:05:19.8 S1: She

0:05:20.4 S1: retreated

0:05:21.9 S1: on

0:05:22.1 S1: the

0:05:22.2 S1: other

0:05:23.1 S1: streets

0:05:23.3 S1: of

0:05:23.5 S1: the

0:05:23.6 S1: playground

0:05:24.9 S1: so

0:05:25.1 S1: she

0:05:25.2 S1: had

0:05:25.3 S1: a

0:05:25.5 S1: general

0:05:26.0 S1: idea

0:05:26.3 S1: but...

0:05:27.5 S1: Her

0:05:27.7 S1: perturbed,

0:05:28.7 S1: she

0:05:29.1 S1: looked

0:05:29.8 S1: at

0:05:30.1 S1: Johnny

0:05:30.7 S1: and

0:05:31.1 S1: said...

0:05:31.7 S2: "Johnny,

0:05:32.3 S2: you've

0:05:32.9 S2: got

0:05:33.1 S2: something

0:05:33.4 S2: on

0:05:33.6 S2: your

0:05:33.8 S2: shirt."

0:05:34.4 S2: And

0:05:34.6 S2: she

0:05:34.8 S2: pointed

0:05:35.1 S2: her

0:05:35.3 S2: finger

0:05:35.6 S2: at

0:05:35.6 S2: his

0:05:35.7 S2: chest.

0:05:35.9 S2: Just

0:05:37.7 S2: then

0:05:37.7 S2: he

0:05:37.9 S2: looked

0:05:38.2 S2: down

0:05:39.0 S2: and

0:05:39.2 S2: while

0:05:39.5 S2: he

0:05:39.6 S2: was

0:05:39.8 S2: looking

0:05:40.2 S2: down,

0:05:40.5 S2: she

0:05:40.8 S2: slapped

0:05:41.1 S2: him

0:05:41.3 S2: in

0:05:41.4 S2: the

0:05:41.5 S2: nose.

0:05:43.1 S2: He

0:05:43.3 S2: started

0:05:43.7 S2: to

0:05:43.8 S2: bleed

0:05:44.1 S2: from

0:05:44.3 S2: his

0:05:44.5 S2: nose

0:05:44.9 S2: and

0:05:45.2 S2: cry

0:05:46.1 S2: and

0:05:46.3 S2: ran

0:05:46.7 S2: to

0:05:46.8 S2: tell

0:05:47.0 S2: the

0:05:47.2 S2: school

0:05:47.5 S2: teachers

0:05:48.0 S2: what

0:05:48.2 S2: Sally

0:05:48.5 S2: had

0:05:48.7 S2: done.

0:05:49.1 S2: Sally

0:05:50.0 S2: looked

0:05:50.2 S2: at

0:05:50.3 S2: her

0:05:50.5 S2: fist

0:05:51.1 S2: and

0:05:51.6 S2: realized

0:05:52.2 S2: that

0:05:52.4 S2: all

0:05:52.6 S2: of

0:05:52.8 S2: the

0:05:53.5 S2: exercising

0:05:54.4 S2: had

0:05:54.7 S2: made

0:05:54.8 S2: her

0:05:54.9 S2: a

0:05:55.0 S2: much

0:05:55.3 S2: angrier

0:05:55.8 S2: person

0:05:56.6 S2: and

0:05:56.8 S2: maybe

0:05:56.9 S2: spending

0:05:57.7 S2: time

0:05:57.8 S2: with

0:05:58.0 S2: her

0:05:58.1 S2: brother

0:05:58.6 S2: wasn't

0:05:59.1 S2: as

0:05:59.3 S2: so

0:05:59.5 S2: much

0:05:59.9 S2: as

0:06:00.1 S2: it

0:06:00.2 S2: was

0:06:00.4 S2: cracked

0:06:00.6 S2: up

0:06:00.7 S2: to

0:06:02.3 S2: be.

0:06:03.3 S1: Yeah.

0:06:03.3 S1: And

0:06:03.3 S1: in

0:06:03.4 S1: addition

0:06:03.9 S1: to

0:06:04.2 S1: what

0:06:04.4 S1: they

0:06:04.6 S1: refer

0:06:04.9 S1: to

0:06:05.0 S1: as

0:06:05.2 S1: weight

0:06:05.8 S1: rage

0:06:06.3 S1: from

0:06:06.7 S1: all

0:06:07.1 S1: the

0:06:07.4 S1: protein

0:06:08.1 S1: shake,

0:06:08.6 S1: had

0:06:09.0 S1: turned

0:06:09.6 S1: Sally

0:06:10.1 S1: into

0:06:10.6 S1: kind

0:06:11.3 S1: of

0:06:11.5 S1: aggressive

0:06:12.1 S1: person.

0:06:12.8 S1: As

0:06:13.8 S1: she

0:06:14.0 S1: was

0:06:14.2 S1: contemplating

0:06:15.0 S1: of

0:06:15.1 S1: the

0:06:15.6 S1: protein

0:06:16.1 S1: shake

0:06:16.4 S1: to

0:06:16.5 S1: the

0:06:16.6 S1: actual

0:06:17.0 S1: morning

0:06:17.3 S1: work

0:06:17.7 S1: out

0:06:18.1 S1: session,

0:06:18.8 S1: Johnny

0:06:19.5 S1: was

0:06:19.7 S1: coming

0:06:20.1 S1: back

0:06:20.4 S1: across

0:06:21.4 S1: the

0:06:21.6 S1: school

0:06:21.9 S1: yard

0:06:22.2 S1: with

0:06:22.4 S1: the

0:06:22.5 S1: other

0:06:22.8 S1: teacher.

0:06:23.3 S1: Sally

0:06:24.2 S1: quickly

0:06:25.3 S1: thought

0:06:25.5 S1: about

0:06:27.3 S1: how

0:06:27.5 S1: this

0:06:27.7 S1: was

0:06:27.9 S1: going

0:06:28.1 S1: to

0:06:28.2 S1: go

0:06:28.4 S1: down.

0:06:32.0 S1: The

0:06:32.2 S1: teacher

0:06:32.2 S1: said,

0:06:33.1 S1: "Sally,

0:06:33.8 S1: what

0:06:34.0 S1: have

0:06:34.2 S1: you

0:06:34.3 S1: done?

0:06:35.1 S1: You

0:06:35.2 S1: used

0:06:35.4 S1: to

0:06:35.6 S1: be

0:06:35.8 S1: such

0:06:36.1 S1: a

0:06:36.2 S1: nice

0:06:36.4 S1: little

0:06:36.6 S1: girl,

0:06:37.1 S1: and

0:06:37.5 S1: now

0:06:37.7 S1: you're

0:06:37.9 S1: starting

0:06:38.2 S1: fights

0:06:38.6 S1: in

0:06:38.7 S1: the

0:06:38.8 S1: schoolyard."

0:06:40.8 S1: Sally

0:06:41.7 S1: tried

0:06:42.0 S1: to

0:06:42.1 S1: tell

0:06:42.3 S1: the

0:06:42.5 S1: teacher

0:06:42.9 S1: that

0:06:43.3 S1: Johnny

0:06:43.6 S1: had

0:06:43.7 S1: made

0:06:44.0 S1: fun

0:06:44.1 S1: of

0:06:44.2 S1: her

0:06:44.5 S1: for

0:06:45.1 S1: falling

0:06:45.4 S1: off

0:06:45.6 S1: the

0:06:45.7 S1: monkey

0:06:46.0 S1: bars,

0:06:47.4 S1: but

0:06:47.5 S1: the

0:06:47.7 S1: teacher

0:06:48.1 S1: wouldn't

0:06:48.4 S1: have

0:06:48.6 S1: it.

0:06:49.0 S1: She

0:06:49.1 S1: brought

0:06:49.3 S1: them

0:06:49.6 S1: both

0:06:49.8 S1: into

0:06:50.1 S1: the

0:06:50.3 S1: school

0:06:51.5 S1: and

0:06:51.7 S1: to

0:06:52.0 S1: the

0:06:52.1 S1: principals

0:06:52.6 S1: office,

0:06:53.8 S1: and

0:06:53.9 S1: described

0:06:54.6 S1: what

0:06:54.8 S1: had

0:06:54.9 S1: happened

0:06:55.4 S1: between

0:06:55.8 S1: the

0:06:56.0 S1: two

0:06:56.3 S1: school

0:06:56.5 S1: children

0:06:57.0 S1: to

0:06:57.2 S1: the

0:06:57.3 S1: principal.

0:06:57.2 S2: The

0:06:58.2 S2: principal

0:06:59.1 S2: has

0:06:59.5 S2: been

0:07:00.0 S2: having

0:07:00.7 S2: a

0:07:00.9 S2: really

0:07:01.5 S2: quiet

0:07:02.1 S2: day

0:07:02.5 S2: in

0:07:02.8 S2: the

0:07:03.1 S2: office

0:07:04.7 S2: when

0:07:04.9 S2: he

0:07:05.1 S2: heard

0:07:05.3 S2: the

0:07:05.5 S2: knock

0:07:05.8 S2: on

0:07:06.0 S2: the

0:07:06.1 S2: door

0:07:06.5 S2: and

0:07:06.8 S2: Sally

0:07:07.2 S2: and

0:07:07.4 S2: Johnny

0:07:07.7 S2: were

0:07:07.8 S2: brought

0:07:08.0 S2: in

0:07:08.2 S2: by

0:07:08.4 S2: the

0:07:08.5 S2: teacher.

0:07:10.4 S2: He

0:07:11.4 S2: was

0:07:11.6 S2: about

0:07:11.8 S2: to

0:07:12.0 S2: eat

0:07:12.2 S2: lunch,

0:07:12.6 S2: 'cause

0:07:12.8 S2: it

0:07:12.9 S2: was

0:07:13.3 S2: lunchtime

0:07:13.8 S2: in

the [0:07:14.0] ____

0:07:14.4 S2: he

0:07:15.4 S2: was

0:07:15.6 S2: very

0:07:15.9 S2: disappointed

0:07:16.6 S2: that

0:07:16.8 S2: he

0:07:17.0 S2: couldn't

0:07:17.8 S2: finish

0:07:18.3 S2: his

0:07:19.5 S2: garden

0:07:20.0 S2: Gouda

0:07:20.0 S2: bowl,

0:07:20.0 S2: but

0:07:20.5 S2: he

0:07:20.9 S2: put

0:07:21.5 S2: it

0:07:22.0 S2: aside

0:07:22.7 S2: ready

0:07:23.0 S2: to

0:07:23.3 S2: talk

0:07:23.6 S2: to

0:07:23.7 S2: the

0:07:23.9 S2: kids

0:07:25.2 S2: who

0:07:25.5 S2: had

0:07:25.8 S2: gotten

0:07:26.2 S2: into

0:07:26.7 S2: the

0:07:27.0 S2: this

0:07:27.7 S2: fight

0:07:28.5 S2: on

0:07:28.9 S2: the

0:07:29.4 S2: schoolyard.

0:07:30.8 S1: The

0:07:31.3 S1: principal

0:07:31.8 S1: noticed

0:07:32.5 S1: that

0:07:32.8 S1: Sally

0:07:33.2 S1: looked

0:07:33.5 S1: much

0:07:33.7 S1: stronger

0:07:34.1 S1: than

0:07:34.3 S1: she

0:07:34.4 S1: did

0:07:34.7 S1: the

0:07:34.8 S1: last

0:07:35.0 S1: time

0:07:36.0 S1: she

0:07:36.2 S1: was

0:07:36.3 S1: in

0:07:36.5 S1: his

0:07:36.7 S1: office

0:07:37.1 S1: for

0:07:37.4 S1: getting

0:07:37.8 S1: extra

0:07:38.9 S1: good

0:07:39.6 S1: grades

0:07:39.9 S1: in

0:07:40.0 S1: school

0:07:40.7 S1: and

0:07:40.9 S1: said,

0:07:41.2 S1: "Sally,

0:07:41.9 S1: is

0:07:42.1 S1: there

0:07:42.4 S1: something

0:07:42.8 S1: that's

0:07:43.0 S1: been

0:07:43.2 S1: going

0:07:43.4 S1: on

0:07:43.6 S1: at

0:07:43.8 S1: home?"

0:07:44.7 S1: Sally

0:07:45.0 S1: described

0:07:45.5 S1: her

0:07:45.6 S1: morning

0:07:45.9 S1: workouts

0:07:46.3 S1: with

0:07:46.5 S1: her

0:07:46.6 S1: brother

0:07:47.3 S1: and

0:07:47.6 S1: her

0:07:48.0 S1: protein

0:07:48.7 S1: shakes

0:07:49.2 S1: that

0:07:49.6 S1: she

0:07:50.0 S1: drinks

0:07:50.5 S1: everyday

0:07:51.2 S1: in

0:07:51.4 S1: order

0:07:51.6 S1: to

0:07:51.7 S1: get

0:07:51.9 S1: strong

0:07:52.6 S1: and

0:07:52.9 S1: the

0:07:53.1 S1: principal

0:07:53.9 S1: knew

0:07:54.3 S1: that

0:07:54.6 S1: something

0:07:55.1 S1: must

0:07:56.0 S1: be

0:07:56.6 S1: wrong.

0:07:57.5 S1: He

0:07:57.7 S1: called

0:07:58.1 S1: Sally's

0:07:58.5 S1: parents

0:07:58.9 S1: and

0:07:59.0 S1: asked

0:07:59.3 S1: them

0:07:59.4 S1: to

0:07:59.5 S1: come

0:07:59.7 S1: in.

0:08:00.9 S2: Sally's

0:08:01.4 S2: parents

0:08:02.8 S2: rushed

0:08:04.0 S2: over

0:08:04.7 S2: from

0:08:05.1 S2: their

0:08:05.3 S2: jobs,

0:08:05.7 S2: Sally

0:08:06.2 S2: have

0:08:06.6 S2: been

0:08:07.0 S2: the

0:08:07.1 S2: easy

0:08:07.4 S2: child,

0:08:07.8 S2: they've

0:08:08.1 S2: never

0:08:08.4 S2: been

0:08:08.6 S2: called

0:08:08.8 S2: to

0:08:09.0 S2: the

0:08:09.1 S2: office

0:08:10.3 S2: for

0:08:10.6 S2: Sally

0:08:11.1 S2: only

0:08:11.4 S2: for

0:08:11.6 S2: her

0:08:11.7 S2: brother.

0:08:13.3 S2: So

0:08:13.4 S2: they

0:08:13.5 S2: were

0:08:13.7 S2: both

0:08:14.0 S2: shocked

0:08:14.4 S2: when

0:08:14.5 S2: they

0:08:14.7 S2: got

0:08:14.8 S2: the

0:08:15.0 S2: text

0:08:15.4 S2: from

0:08:15.6 S2: the

0:08:15.7 S2: school

0:08:16.6 S2: to

0:08:16.8 S2: come

0:08:17.0 S2: into

0:08:17.2 S2: the

0:08:17.4 S2: principal's

0:08:17.8 S2: office.

0:08:19.7 S2: When

0:08:19.8 S2: they

0:08:20.0 S2: arrived,

0:08:20.8 S2: they

0:08:21.0 S2: looked

0:08:21.6 S2: at

0:08:21.8 S2: Sally,

0:08:22.3 S2: looked

0:08:22.8 S2: at

0:08:23.1 S2: Johnny

0:08:23.6 S2: whose

0:08:24.1 S2: nose

0:08:24.5 S2: is

0:08:24.7 S2: bleeding,

0:08:25.3 S2: and

0:08:25.5 S2: they

0:08:25.8 S2: shook

0:08:26.1 S2: their

0:08:26.4 S2: heads

0:08:26.7 S2: in

0:08:27.0 S2: amazement,

0:08:28.3 S2: they

0:08:28.5 S2: hadn't

0:08:28.8 S2: noticed

0:08:29.8 S2: that

0:08:30.0 S2: Sally

0:08:30.2 S2: has

0:08:30.4 S2: gotten

0:08:30.8 S2: so

0:08:31.0 S2: strong.

0:08:32.8 S1: They

0:08:33.0 S1: said,

0:08:33.3 S1: "Sally,

0:08:33.7 S1: how

0:08:33.9 S1: could

0:08:34.1 S1: you

0:08:34.2 S1: have

0:08:34.4 S1: done

0:08:34.6 S1: this?

0:08:35.4 S1: Are

0:08:35.6 S1: you

0:08:36.0 S1: learning

0:08:36.5 S1: how

0:08:36.6 S1: to

0:08:36.8 S1: fight

0:08:37.1 S1: from

0:08:37.3 S1: your

0:08:37.5 S1: brother?

0:08:38.2 S1: Is

0:08:38.5 S1: he

0:08:38.8 S1: teaching

0:08:39.1 S1: you

0:08:39.3 S1: to

0:08:39.4 S1: be

0:08:40.1 S1: a

0:08:40.2 S1: violent

0:08:40.7 S1: and

0:08:40.8 S1: aggressive

0:08:41.3 S1: child?"

0:08:43.5 S1: Sally

0:08:43.9 S1: just

0:08:44.5 S1: shook

0:08:44.7 S1: her

0:08:44.8 S1: head

0:08:45.6 S1: and

0:08:46.0 S1: looked

0:08:46.2 S1: up

0:08:46.4 S1: at

0:08:46.6 S1: the

0:08:46.9 S1: sky,

0:08:47.2 S1: she

0:08:47.3 S1: said,

0:08:47.9 S1: "I

0:08:48.1 S1: just

0:08:48.4 S1: wanted

0:08:48.7 S1: to

0:08:48.9 S1: cross

0:08:49.2 S1: on

0:08:49.4 S1: the

0:08:49.5 S1: monkey

0:08:49.8 S1: bars,

0:08:50.6 S1: Sam's

0:08:51.2 S1: been

0:08:51.4 S1: teaching

0:08:51.8 S1: me

0:08:52.9 S1: to

0:08:53.7 S1: get

0:08:54.0 S1: strong

0:08:54.4 S1: but

0:08:54.7 S1: I

0:08:54.9 S1: still

0:08:55.3 S1: can't

0:08:55.7 S1: do

0:08:55.9 S1: it."

0:08:56.1 S1: Her

0:08:56.3 S1: parents

0:08:57.1 S1: were

0:08:57.9 S1: very

0:08:58.1 S1: confused

0:08:58.8 S1: and

0:08:59.1 S1: turned

0:08:59.3 S1: towards

0:08:59.6 S1: the

0:08:59.7 S1: principal.

0:09:03.9 S2: The

0:09:05.0 S2: principal

0:09:05.0 S2: also

0:09:05.1 S2: shook

0:09:05.1 S2: his

0:09:05.1 S2: head,"

0:09:05.2 S2: Most

0:09:05.2 S2: kids

0:09:05.2 S2: weren't

0:09:05.3 S2: this

0:09:05.3 S2: focused

0:09:05.4 S2: on

0:09:05.6 S2: getting

0:09:05.8 S2: across

0:09:06.2 S2: the

0:09:06.3 S2: monkey

0:09:06.6 S2: bars,

0:09:08.0 S2: they

0:09:08.2 S2: looked

0:09:08.4 S2: at

0:09:08.5 S2: it

0:09:08.8 S2: decided

0:09:09.2 S2: if

0:09:09.4 S2: they

0:09:09.5 S2: wanted

0:09:09.8 S2: to

0:09:10.0 S2: do

0:09:10.1 S2: it

0:09:10.2 S2: and

0:09:10.4 S2: did

0:09:10.6 S2: it

0:09:10.7 S2: or

0:09:10.8 S2: they

0:09:11.0 S2: gave

0:09:11.2 S2: up.

0:09:12.0 S2: This

0:09:12.2 S2: was

0:09:12.7 S2: very

0:09:12.7 S2: very

0:09:12.8 S2: determined

0:09:14.3 S2: young

0:09:14.6 S2: girl,

0:09:15.3 S2: and

0:09:15.8 S2: unfortunately

0:09:16.6 S2: the

0:09:16.9 S2: focus

0:09:17.4 S2: on

0:09:17.5 S2: the

0:09:17.6 S2: monkey

0:09:18.1 S2: bars

0:09:18.4 S2: has

0:09:18.7 S2: had

0:09:18.9 S2: resulted

0:09:20.6 S2: in

0:09:22.1 S2: a

0:09:22.6 S2: rather

0:09:23.0 S2: poor

0:09:23.3 S2: outcome

0:09:23.8 S2: for

0:09:24.0 S2: everyone

0:09:24.4 S2: involved.

0:09:25.0 S2: However

0:09:26.3 S2: Sally

0:09:27.2 S2: was

0:09:27.4 S2: very

0:09:27.8 S2: strong

0:09:28.1 S2: now

0:09:28.6 S2: so

0:09:28.8 S2: maybe

0:09:28.9 S2: she

0:09:29.0 S2: could

0:09:29.2 S2: use

0:09:29.4 S2: this

0:09:29.6 S2: for

0:09:30.6 S2: something

0:09:32.2 S2: else."

0:09:33.0 S1: "Yes

0:09:33.6 S1: the

0:09:34.1 S1: problem

0:09:35.4 S1: had

0:09:35.6 S1: been

0:09:35.8 S1: that

0:09:36.2 S1: Sally

0:09:36.7 S1: did

0:09:37.0 S1: not

0:09:37.2 S1: really

0:09:37.5 S1: work

0:09:37.7 S1: on

0:09:37.9 S1: her

0:09:38.0 S1: grip

0:09:38.3 S1: strength,

0:09:39.0 S1: so

0:09:39.3 S1: even

0:09:39.5 S1: though

0:09:39.8 S1: her

0:09:40.1 S1: arms

0:09:40.4 S1: were

0:09:40.6 S1: very

0:09:40.9 S1: strong,

0:09:42.0 S1: she

0:09:42.2 S1: was

0:09:42.3 S1: unable

0:09:42.7 S1: to

0:09:42.8 S1: hold

0:09:43.1 S1: on

0:09:43.3 S1: to

0:09:43.4 S1: the

0:09:43.5 S1: bars

0:09:43.8 S1: the

0:09:43.9 S1: entire

0:09:44.4 S1: way

0:09:44.5 S1: across"

0:09:46.4 S1: The

0:09:46.5 S1: principal

0:09:47.1 S1: who

0:09:47.4 S1: used

0:09:47.5 S1: to

0:09:47.7 S1: be

0:09:47.9 S1: a

0:09:48.0 S1: crossfit

0:09:48.5 S1: instructor

0:09:49.1 S1: gave

0:09:49.7 S1: her

0:09:50.1 S1: some

0:09:50.6 S1: exercises

0:09:51.7 S1: to

0:09:51.9 S1: do

0:09:52.4 S1: like

0:09:53.0 S1: towel

0:09:53.5 S1: hangs

0:09:53.9 S1: and

0:09:54.3 S1: gripping

0:09:55.3 S1: exercises,

0:09:57.4 S1: and

0:09:58.4 S1: Sally

0:09:58.9 S1: parents

0:09:59.2 S1: decided

0:09:59.6 S1: to

0:09:59.8 S1: check

0:09:60.0 S1: the

0:10:00.2 S1: contents

0:10:00.6 S1: of

0:10:00.8 S1: these

0:10:01.0 S1: protein

0:10:01.9 S1: shakes.

0:10:04.9 S2: Yeah

0:10:05.1 S2: upon

0:10:05.3 S2: doing

0:10:05.6 S2: so,

0:10:05.7 S2: it

0:10:05.9 S2: turned

0:10:06.2 S2: out

0:10:06.4 S2: everything

0:10:06.8 S2: was

0:10:07.1 S2: not

0:10:07.3 S2: kosher

0:10:08.0 S2: and

0:10:08.4 S2: these

0:10:09.4 S2: protein

0:10:10.9 S2: shakes

0:10:12.0 S2: in

0:10:12.1 S2: addition

0:10:12.7 S2: to

0:10:13.2 S2: having

0:10:13.6 S2: some

0:10:13.9 S2: extra

0:10:14.4 S2: supplements

0:10:15.2 S2: or

0:10:15.4 S2: similar

0:10:15.9 S2: to

0:10:16.2 S2: the

0:10:16.5 S2: protein

0:10:17.3 S2: given

0:10:17.9 S2: to

0:10:18.2 S2: Regina

0:10:18.9 S2: in

0:10:19.1 S2: the

0:10:19.5 S2: 'Mean

0:10:20.1 S2: girls'

0:10:20.7 S2: so

0:10:21.1 S2: it

0:10:21.2 S2: was

0:10:21.5 S2: not

0:10:21.9 S2: great

0:10:22.2 S2: there,

0:10:23.5 S2: and

0:10:23.8 S2: quickly

0:10:24.9 S2: stopped

0:10:25.9 S2: all

0:10:26.1 S2: purchasing

0:10:26.8 S2: of

0:10:27.0 S2: this

0:10:27.2 S2: protein

0:10:27.7 S2: powders

0:10:29.7 S2: and

0:10:30.7 S2: Sally...

0:10:32.2 S1: It

0:10:32.9 S1: turns

0:10:34.4 S1: out

0:10:35.2 S1: that

0:10:36.0 S1: the

0:10:36.7 S1: extra

0:10:37.0 S1: supplements

0:10:37.5 S1: in

0:10:37.5 S1: the

0:10:37.6 S1: protein

0:10:38.0 S1: powder

0:10:38.8 S1: were

0:10:39.0 S1: actually

0:10:39.4 S1: steroids

0:10:40.2 S1: that

0:10:40.6 S1: Sally's

0:10:41.3 S1: brother

0:10:41.6 S1: had

0:10:41.8 S1: been

0:10:41.9 S1: using

0:10:42.4 S1: to

0:10:42.5 S1: get

0:10:42.9 S1: super

0:10:43.3 S1: strong,

0:10:43.9 S1: and

0:10:44.1 S1: that

0:10:44.3 S1: accounted

0:10:44.9 S1: both

0:10:45.2 S1: Sally's

0:10:45.9 S1: meteoritic

0:10:46.7 S1: gain

0:10:47.1 S1: of

0:10:47.4 S1: muscle

0:10:48.4 S1: mass

0:10:48.9 S1: and

0:10:49.2 S1: her

0:10:49.8 S1: rage

0:10:50.3 S1: symptoms

0:10:50.9 S1: on

0:10:51.2 S1: the

0:10:51.4 S1: school

0:10:51.7 S1: playground.

0:10:53.9 S1: So

0:10:55.0 S1: the

0:10:55.4 S1: parents

0:10:55.7 S1: decided

0:10:56.2 S1: to

0:10:56.4 S1: then

0:10:56.7 S1: punish

0:10:57.1 S1: Sally's

0:10:57.5 S1: brother

0:10:58.2 S1: and

0:10:58.5 S1: made

0:10:58.8 S1: sure

0:10:59.1 S1: they

0:10:59.4 S1: didn't

0:10:59.7 S1: have

0:10:59.9 S1: any

0:11:00.7 S1: of

0:11:00.9 S1: those

0:11:01.3 S1: protein

0:11:01.9 S1: shakes.

0:11:05.4 S2: So

0:11:02.6 S2: with

0:11:02.9 S2: the

0:11:03.2 S2: protein

0:11:03.7 S2: shakes

0:11:04.2 S2: out

0:11:04.5 S2: of

0:11:04.7 S2: the

0:11:04.9 S2: way,

0:11:06.8 S2: the

0:11:07.2 S2: other

0:11:07.2 S2: problem

0:11:07.9 S2: was

0:11:09.3 S2: the

0:11:09.5 S2: fact

0:11:09.9 S2: that

0:11:10.2 S2: Sally's

0:11:10.6 S2: grip

0:11:10.9 S2: strength

0:11:11.3 S2: was

0:11:11.7 S2: still

0:11:12.0 S2: sub-

0:11:12.4 S2: par.

0:11:14.0 S2: So

0:11:14.6 S2: in

0:11:14.7 S2: addition

0:11:15.1 S2: to

0:11:15.2 S2: the

0:11:15.4 S2: crossfit,

0:11:16.5 S2: her

0:11:16.7 S2: parents

0:11:17.2 S2: decided

0:11:17.9 S2: that

0:11:18.3 S2: maybe

0:11:18.6 S2: going

0:11:18.9 S2: through

0:11:19.0 S2: a

0:11:19.2 S2: rock

0:11:19.5 S2: climbing

0:11:20.4 S2: game

0:11:20.6 S2: would

0:11:20.8 S2: be

0:11:21.0 S2: a

0:11:21.0 S2: good

0:11:21.2 S2: idea,

0:11:22.0 S2: so

0:11:22.2 S2: that

0:11:22.8 S2: she

0:11:23.0 S2: could

0:11:23.2 S2: best

0:11:23.4 S2: work

0:11:23.6 S2: on

0:11:23.9 S2: her

0:11:24.1 S2: grip

0:11:24.3 S2: strength

0:11:24.7 S2: and

0:11:25.0 S2: her

0:11:25.1 S2: arm

0:11:25.5 S2: strength

0:11:26.0 S2: and

0:11:27.0 S2: they

0:11:27.2 S2: forced

0:11:27.4 S2: her

0:11:27.6 S2: brother

0:11:27.9 S2: to

0:11:28.0 S2: go

0:11:28.1 S2: along

0:11:28.4 S2: as

0:11:28.6 S2: punishment

0:11:29.2 S2: to

0:11:29.3 S2: watch

0:11:29.5 S2: her.

0:11:30.9 S1: While,

0:11:30.6 S1: Sally's

0:11:31.6 S1: brother

0:11:32.5 S1: was

0:11:32.8 S1: bullying

0:11:33.3 S1: her

0:11:33.6 S1: at

0:11:33.8 S1: the

0:11:34.0 S1: rock

0:11:34.3 S1: gym,

0:11:34.5 S1: she

0:11:34.7 S1: decided

0:11:35.2 S1: she

0:11:35.4 S1: really

0:11:35.7 S1: enjoyed

0:11:36.0 S1: it.

0:11:36.1 S1: Climbing

0:11:36.9 S1: up

0:11:37.2 S1: walls

0:11:37.7 S1: was

0:11:38.0 S1: way

0:11:38.4 S1: more

0:11:38.8 S1: fun

0:11:39.1 S1: than

0:11:39.4 S1: climbing

0:11:40.1 S1: across

0:11:40.4 S1: monkey

0:11:40.7 S1: bars

0:11:41.5 S1: and

0:11:41.9 S1: the

0:11:42.0 S1: little

0:11:42.8 S1: plastic

0:11:43.1 S1: holes

0:11:43.4 S1: in

0:11:43.5 S1: the

0:11:43.6 S1: wall

0:11:44.1 S1: were

0:11:44.6 S1: really

0:11:44.9 S1: improved

0:11:45.2 S1: her

0:11:45.4 S1: grip

0:11:45.6 S1: strength

0:11:45.9 S1: compared

0:11:46.4 S1: to

0:11:47.1 S1: the

0:11:47.5 S1: weird

0:11:47.9 S1: exercises

0:11:48.6 S1: that

0:11:48.8 S1: her

0:11:49.0 S1: brother

0:11:49.4 S1: had

0:11:49.6 S1: been

0:11:49.7 S1: having

0:11:50.0 S1: her

0:11:50.3 S1: do,

0:11:50.6 S1: like

0:11:51.3 S1: bicep

0:11:52.1 S1: curls

0:11:52.7 S1: and

0:11:52.9 S1: other

0:11:53.2 S1: things

0:11:53.4 S1: that

0:11:53.6 S1: were

0:11:53.8 S1: really

0:11:54.0 S1: only

0:11:54.3 S1: working

0:11:55.1 S1: on

0:11:55.4 S1: her

0:11:55.7 S1: glory

0:11:56.6 S1: muscles

0:11:57.8 S1: she

0:11:58.4 S1: became

0:11:59.4 S1: lean

0:12:00.2 S1: and

0:12:00.8 S1: strong

0:12:01.8 S1: at

0:12:02.3 S1: the

0:12:02.9 S1: climbing

0:12:04.2 S1: gym.

0:12:04.9 S2: This

0:12:05.4 S2: went

0:12:05.6 S2: on

0:12:05.9 S2: for

0:12:06.1 S2: several

0:12:06.4 S2: weeks,

0:12:06.9 S2: Sally

0:12:07.3 S2: climbing

0:12:07.9 S2: at

0:12:08.2 S2: the

0:12:08.4 S2: climbing

0:12:09.1 S2: gym

0:12:09.3 S2: and

0:12:09.6 S2: her

0:12:09.8 S2: brother

0:12:10.3 S2: bullying

0:12:12.0 S2: her.

0:12:12.6 S2: She

0:12:12.8 S2: was

0:12:12.9 S2: mastering

0:12:13.9 S2: all

0:12:14.2 S2: sorts

0:12:14.4 S2: of

0:12:14.6 S2: levels

0:12:15.0 S2: of

0:12:15.2 S2: rock

0:12:15.5 S2: climbing,

0:12:16.5 S2: which

0:12:16.7 S2: is

0:12:16.8 S2: good,

0:12:18.3 S2: and

0:12:18.7 S2: so

0:12:19.0 S2: finally

0:12:20.1 S2: she

0:12:20.6 S2: had

0:12:21.0 S2: pretty

0:12:21.2 S2: much

0:12:21.4 S2: ignored

0:12:21.8 S2: the

0:12:21.9 S2: monkey

0:12:22.2 S2: bars

0:12:23.4 S2: after

0:12:23.7 S2: the

0:12:23.8 S2: incident,

0:12:24.5 S2: but

0:12:25.4 S2: went

0:12:25.7 S2: back

0:12:26.0 S2: on

0:12:26.3 S2: a

0:12:26.5 S2: warm

0:12:27.2 S2: sunny

0:12:27.9 S2: Tuesday

0:12:28.8 S2: to

0:12:29.0 S2: conquer

0:12:29.4 S2: them.

0:12:31.8 S1: This

0:12:32.1 S1: time,

0:12:32.5 S1: Sally

0:12:33.1 S1: made

0:12:33.5 S1: sure

0:12:33.9 S1: that

0:12:34.2 S1: Johnny

0:12:34.5 S1: was

0:12:34.7 S1: there

0:12:35.8 S1: to

0:12:36.2 S1: see.

0:12:37.0 S1: She

0:12:37.0 S1: grabbed

0:12:37.3 S1: the

0:12:37.4 S1: first

0:12:37.7 S1: monkey

0:12:38.1 S1: bar,

0:12:38.4 S1: and

0:12:38.7 S1: she

0:12:38.9 S1: felt

0:12:39.2 S1: so

0:12:39.4 S1: confident

0:12:40.4 S1: that

0:12:40.9 S1: she

0:12:41.3 S1: skipped

0:12:42.0 S1: one

0:12:42.2 S1: of

0:12:42.3 S1: them

0:12:42.5 S1: doing

0:12:42.9 S1: basically

0:12:43.4 S1: every

0:12:43.7 S1: other

0:12:44.0 S1: monkey

0:12:44.2 S1: bar

0:12:44.7 S1: the

0:12:44.7 S1: entire

0:12:45.1 S1: way

0:12:45.2 S1: across

0:12:45.8 S1: and

0:12:46.2 S1: swinging

0:12:47.1 S1: with

0:12:47.2 S1: her

0:12:47.4 S1: added

0:12:47.9 S1: grip

0:12:48.1 S1: strength

0:12:48.5 S1: and

0:12:48.7 S1: core

0:12:49.3 S1: strength

0:12:49.4 S1: that

0:12:49.6 S1: she

0:12:49.7 S1: had

0:12:49.9 S1: gotten

0:12:50.0 S1: from

0:12:50.4 S1: the

0:12:50.5 S1: climbing

0:12:50.9 S1: gym

0:12:51.7 S1: to

0:12:52.0 S1: easily

0:12:52.7 S1: get

0:12:52.9 S1: across

0:12:53.2 S1: the

0:12:53.4 S1: monkey

0:12:54.2 S1: bars.

0:12:54.7 S1: She

0:12:55.2 S1: stepped

0:12:56.0 S1: on

0:12:56.2 S1: the

0:12:56.3 S1: ground

0:12:56.5 S1: and

0:12:57.2 S1: said,

0:12:58.0 S1: "In

0:12:58.1 S1: your

0:12:58.2 S1: face

0:12:58.3 S1: Johnny,

0:12:58.5 S1: let's

0:12:58.7 S1: see

0:12:58.8 S1: if

0:12:58.9 S1: you

0:12:59.0 S1: can

0:12:59.2 S1: do

0:12:59.3 S1: it."

0:13:00.2 S2: Now

0:13:01.0 S2: Johnny

0:13:03.2 S2: as

0:13:03.5 S2: a

0:13:03.6 S2: bully

0:13:04.0 S2: was

0:13:04.6 S2: normally

0:13:05.0 S2: very

0:13:05.4 S2: outgoing,

0:13:06.0 S2: but

0:13:06.3 S2: now

0:13:06.5 S2: he

0:13:06.6 S2: was

0:13:06.7 S2: being

0:13:06.9 S2: shown

0:13:07.2 S2: up

0:13:07.3 S2: by

0:13:07.5 S2: a

0:13:07.6 S2: girl,

0:13:08.7 S2: so

0:13:08.9 S2: of

0:13:09.0 S2: course,

0:13:10.1 S2: he

0:13:10.6 S2: rushed

0:13:10.9 S2: up

0:13:11.1 S2: to

0:13:11.3 S2: his

0:13:11.4 S2: first

0:13:11.7 S2: monkey

0:13:12.0 S2: bar,

0:13:13.2 S2: and

0:13:13.9 S2: was

0:13:14.1 S2: very

0:13:14.4 S2: confident,

0:13:15.0 S2: he

0:13:15.2 S2: had

0:13:15.5 S2: seen

0:13:15.7 S2: Sally

0:13:16.0 S2: just

0:13:16.3 S2: skip

0:13:16.5 S2: one

0:13:16.7 S2: bar,

0:13:17.1 S2: so

0:13:17.5 S2: he

0:13:17.6 S2: just

0:13:17.8 S2: said,

0:13:18.8 S2: "Alright,

0:13:19.4 S2: I'm

0:13:19.5 S2: gonna

0:13:19.8 S2: do

0:13:19.9 S2: that

0:13:20.0 S2: as

0:13:20.2 S2: well".

0:13:21.4 S2: So

0:13:21.8 S2: he

0:13:22.0 S2: got

0:13:22.3 S2: the

0:13:22.5 S2: first

0:13:22.8 S2: one,

0:13:23.1 S2: skipped

0:13:23.7 S2: the

0:13:24.0 S2: second,

0:13:25.3 S2: made

0:13:25.3 S2: it

0:13:25.3 S2: to

0:13:25.5 S2: the

0:13:25.6 S2: third,

0:13:28.5 S2: and

0:13:28.6 S2: the

0:13:28.6 S2: fifth

0:13:28.6 S2: and

0:13:28.6 S2: then

0:13:28.8 S2: all

0:13:28.9 S2: of

0:13:29.7 S2: a

0:13:30.2 S2: sudden

he [0:13:32.1] ____.

0:13:32.6 S1: He

0:13:32.7 S1: was

0:13:33.0 S1: like,

0:13:33.2 S1: "I

0:13:33.4 S1: can't

0:13:33.7 S1: do

0:13:33.9 S1: this,

0:13:34.3 S1: my

0:13:34.4 S1: grip

0:13:34.6 S1: strength

0:13:35.1 S1: is

0:13:35.2 S1: not

0:13:35.4 S1: good

0:13:35.5 S1: enough.

0:13:36.7 S1: Why

0:13:36.9 S1: is

0:13:37.1 S1: the

0:13:37.3 S1: school

0:13:37.6 S1: building

0:13:37.9 S1: monkey

0:13:38.2 S1: bars

0:13:38.5 S1: that

0:13:38.7 S1: are

0:13:38.9 S1: basically

0:13:39.4 S1: impossible

0:13:40.1 S1: for

0:13:40.4 S1: any

0:13:40.9 S1: kids

0:13:41.3 S1: to

0:13:41.5 S1: cross."

0:13:41.9 S1: Johnny

0:13:42.4 S1: fell

0:13:42.7 S1: on

0:13:43.0 S1: the

0:13:43.2 S1: ground

0:13:43.7 S1: and

0:13:43.9 S1: just

0:13:44.3 S1: then

0:13:44.6 S1: Sally

0:13:44.9 S1: was

0:13:45.1 S1: overwhelmed

0:13:45.7 S1: with

0:13:45.9 S1: compassion,

0:13:47.0 S1: she

0:13:47.2 S1: helped

0:13:47.6 S1: Johnny

0:13:47.8 S1: up

0:13:48.0 S1: off

0:13:48.2 S1: of

0:13:48.3 S1: the

0:13:48.5 S1: ground

0:13:49.1 S1: and

0:13:49.3 S1: said,

0:13:49.8 S1: "Johnny,

0:13:50.2 S1: you

0:13:50.3 S1: need

0:13:50.4 S1: to

0:13:50.5 S1: come

0:13:50.8 S1: climbing

0:13:51.4 S1: at

0:13:51.5 S1: the

0:13:51.6 S1: rock

0:13:51.8 S1: climbing

0:13:52.5 S1: gym

0:13:52.8 S1: with

0:13:53.3 S1: me

0:13:53.5 S1: and

0:13:53.8 S1: train

0:13:54.2 S1: your

0:13:54.5 S1: grip

0:13:54.9 S1: strength

0:13:55.6 S1: and

0:13:55.9 S1: arm."

0:13:56.2 S1: So

0:13:56.5 S1: from

0:13:56.8 S1: then

0:13:57.2 S1: on

0:13:57.5 S1: Johnny

0:13:58.0 S1: ans

0:13:58.3 S1: Sally

0:13:58.7 S1: went

0:13:58.9 S1: together

0:13:59.4 S1: after

0:13:59.7 S1: school

0:13:60.0 S1: to

0:14:00.1 S1: the

0:14:00.2 S1: Rock

0:14:00.6 S1: climbing

0:14:01.3 S1: gym.

0:14:01.7 S2: It

0:14:01.8 S2: was

0:14:02.2 S2: great

0:14:02.6 S2: they

0:14:03.0 S2: had

0:14:03.3 S2: completely

0:14:04.2 S2: ignored

0:14:04.8 S2: the

0:14:05.1 S2: monkey

0:14:05.7 S2: bars

0:14:06.0 S2: which

0:14:06.7 S2: the

0:14:06.9 S2: school

0:14:07.1 S2: has

0:14:07.3 S2: been

0:14:07.7 S2: forming

0:14:08.1 S2: investigation

0:14:08.8 S2: into

0:14:09.2 S2: seeing

0:14:09.8 S2: as

0:14:10.0 S2: no

0:14:10.2 S2: one

0:14:10.4 S2: should

0:14:10.6 S2: to

0:14:10.8 S2: get

0:14:11.1 S2: across

0:14:11.6 S2: these

0:14:12.0 S2: monkey

0:14:12.5 S2: bars.

0:14:12.8 S2: And

0:14:13.0 S2: they

0:14:13.2 S2: will

0:14:13.3 S2: just

0:14:13.5 S2: go

0:14:13.8 S2: to

0:14:14.1 S2: the

0:14:14.6 S2: climbing

0:14:15.6 S2: gym.

0:14:15.9 S2: After

0:14:16.3 S2: they

0:14:16.3 S2: got

0:14:16.3 S2: very

0:14:16.3 S2: good

0:14:16.3 S2: at

0:14:16.3 S2: climbing

0:14:16.3 S2: up

0:14:16.3 S2: the

0:14:16.9 S2: walls

0:14:18.9 S2: on

0:14:20.5 S2: the

0:14:20.6 S2: rope,

0:14:21.6 S2: they

0:14:21.7 S2: decided

0:14:22.2 S2: they

0:14:22.3 S2: would

0:14:22.6 S2: tackle

0:14:22.9 S2: bouldering

0:14:23.4 S2: as

0:14:23.6 S2: well,

0:14:25.9 S2: so

0:14:26.6 S2: they

0:14:26.8 S2: spend

0:14:27.5 S2: their

0:14:27.8 S2: afternoons

0:14:28.1 S2: bouldering

0:14:28.5 S2: and

0:14:28.7 S2: climbing

0:14:29.0 S2: at

0:14:29.1 S2: the

0:14:29.2 S2: rock
