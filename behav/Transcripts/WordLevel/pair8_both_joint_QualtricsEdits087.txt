0:00:00.0 S1: One

0:00:00.3 S1: day,

0:00:00.6 S1: the

0:00:00.9 S1: students

0:00:01.5 S1: were

0:00:01.8 S1: on

0:00:02.0 S1: a

0:00:02.0 S1: field

0:00:02.0 S1: trip.

0:00:03.6 S1: They

0:00:04.2 S1: had

0:00:04.4 S1: just

0:00:04.6 S1: gotten

0:00:04.9 S1: done

0:00:06.3 S1: observing

0:00:06.8 S1: little

0:00:07.1 S1: Johnny

0:00:07.6 S1: making

0:00:07.8 S1: mischief

0:00:08.1 S1: in

0:00:08.2 S1: class,

0:00:08.7 S1: and

0:00:08.8 S1: they

0:00:09.0 S1: were

0:00:09.1 S1: ready

0:00:09.4 S1: to

0:00:09.5 S1: get

0:00:09.7 S1: out

0:00:09.8 S1: of

0:00:09.9 S1: the

0:00:10.0 S1: classroom.

0:00:11.5 S1: As

0:00:11.7 S1: they

0:00:11.8 S1: walked

0:00:12.3 S1: over

0:00:12.6 S1: to

0:00:12.7 S1: the

0:00:13.0 S1: school

0:00:13.3 S1: bus,

0:00:13.5 S1: they

0:00:13.7 S1: were

0:00:13.9 S1: all

0:00:14.1 S1: in

0:00:14.3 S1: awe,

0:00:15.5 S1: a

0:00:15.7 S1: spaceship

0:00:16.4 S1: was

0:00:16.7 S1: floating

0:00:17.0 S1: right

0:00:17.2 S1: above

0:00:17.5 S1: the

0:00:17.6 S1: bus,

0:00:18.8 S1: and

0:00:19.1 S1: as

0:00:19.3 S1: it

0:00:19.5 S1: landed,

0:00:20.3 S1: a

0:00:20.4 S1: little

0:00:20.7 S1: door

0:00:20.9 S1: opened,

0:00:21.4 S1: some

0:00:21.9 S1: stairs

0:00:22.4 S1: folded

0:00:23.0 S1: down

0:00:23.2 S1: to

0:00:23.3 S1: the

0:00:23.5 S1: ground.

0:00:24.6 S1: What

0:00:24.8 S1: they

0:00:25.0 S1: saw,

0:00:25.2 S1: they

0:00:25.3 S1: couldn't

0:00:25.7 S1: believe.

0:00:26.2 S2: The

0:00:26.7 S2: spaceship

0:00:28.0 S2: was

0:00:28.5 S2: enormous,

0:00:29.6 S2: it

0:00:30.0 S2: was

0:00:30.4 S2: about

0:00:30.6 S2: the

0:00:30.7 S2: size

0:00:30.9 S2: of

0:00:31.2 S2: two

0:00:31.3 S2: or

0:00:31.4 S2: four

0:00:33.0 S2: houses

0:00:33.5 S2: on

0:00:33.6 S2: top

0:00:33.8 S2: of

0:00:34.0 S2: each

0:00:34.2 S2: other.

0:00:34.5 S2: And

0:00:34.6 S2: it

0:00:34.7 S2: was

0:00:35.8 S2: shaped

0:00:36.2 S2: like

0:00:37.2 S2: an

0:00:37.3 S2: upside-

0:00:37.7 S2: down

0:00:38.0 S2: pyramid,

0:00:39.5 S2: and

0:00:40.3 S2: there

0:00:41.4 S2: was

0:00:42.2 S2: this

0:00:43.1 S2: purple

0:00:44.4 S2: smoke

0:00:45.5 S2: coming

0:00:46.6 S2: out

0:00:46.8 S2: of

0:00:46.9 S2: the

0:00:47.0 S2: bottom

0:00:47.9 S2: of

0:00:48.2 S2: it,

0:00:48.5 S2: and

0:00:48.9 S2: they

0:00:49.5 S2: saw

0:00:50.0 S2: a

0:00:50.1 S2: figure,

0:00:50.6 S2: a

0:00:51.0 S2: tall

0:00:52.1 S2: humanoid

0:00:54.0 S2: figure

0:00:55.5 S2: at

0:00:55.9 S2: the

0:00:56.1 S2: bottom,

0:00:56.1 S2: but

0:00:56.2 S2: something

0:00:56.3 S2: was

0:00:56.4 S2: different.

0:00:56.9 S1: The

0:00:57.7 S1: humanoid

0:00:59.6 S1: figure

0:01:00.8 S1: didn't

0:01:01.1 S1: have

0:01:01.3 S1: much

0:01:01.5 S1: to

0:01:01.7 S1: say

0:01:02.0 S1: at

0:01:02.2 S1: first,

0:01:02.6 S1: it

0:01:02.8 S1: stood

0:01:03.3 S1: and

0:01:03.6 S1: stared.

0:01:04.1 S1: The

0:01:04.2 S1: purple

0:01:04.6 S1: smoke

0:01:04.9 S1: was

0:01:05.2 S1: surrounding

0:01:05.7 S1: it

0:01:06.6 S1: more

0:01:06.8 S1: and

0:01:07.1 S1: more.

0:01:08.2 S1: They

0:01:08.4 S1: wondered

0:01:08.7 S1: whether

0:01:09.0 S1: the

0:01:09.2 S1: smoke

0:01:09.4 S1: was

0:01:09.6 S1: coming

0:01:10.0 S1: from

0:01:10.2 S1: the

0:01:10.3 S1: creature

0:01:10.8 S1: or

0:01:10.9 S1: whether

0:01:11.3 S1: it

0:01:11.4 S1: was

0:01:11.5 S1: coming

0:01:11.8 S1: from

0:01:12.0 S1: the

0:01:12.2 S1: spaceship.

0:01:13.2 S1: All

0:01:13.4 S1: of

0:01:13.6 S1: a

0:01:13.6 S1: sudden,

0:01:14.0 S1: the

0:01:14.2 S1: spaceship

0:01:14.7 S1: began

0:01:14.9 S1: to

0:01:15.1 S1: transform.

0:01:16.2 S1: It

0:01:16.4 S1: was

0:01:16.5 S1: an

0:01:16.7 S1: upside-

0:01:17.0 S1: down

0:01:17.2 S1: pyramid,

0:01:17.8 S1: but

0:01:18.1 S1: out

0:01:18.4 S1: came

0:01:18.7 S1: some

0:01:19.3 S1: wings,

0:01:19.7 S1: and

0:01:19.8 S1: then

0:01:20.0 S1: some

0:01:20.2 S1: little

0:01:20.5 S1: legs,

0:01:21.0 S1: it

0:01:21.3 S1: started

0:01:22.0 S1: walking

0:01:22.4 S1: around,

0:01:23.2 S1: and

0:01:23.3 S1: then

0:01:23.4 S1: it

0:01:23.6 S1: folded

0:01:23.9 S1: itself

0:01:24.3 S1: up

0:01:24.4 S1: into

0:01:24.8 S1: a

0:01:24.8 S1: little

0:01:25.1 S1: box.

0:01:29.9 S2: The

0:01:30.4 S2: students

0:01:30.9 S2: approached

0:01:31.4 S2: the

0:01:31.6 S2: box

0:01:32.0 S2: like

0:01:32.5 S2: crazy

0:01:33.0 S2: people,

0:01:34.3 S2: with

0:01:35.3 S2: no

0:01:35.9 S2: abandon.

0:01:37.2 S2: And

0:01:38.0 S2: the

0:01:38.2 S2: box

0:01:38.7 S2: began

0:01:39.5 S2: to

0:01:39.9 S2: shake

0:01:40.6 S2: a

0:01:40.6 S2: little

0:01:40.9 S2: bit,

0:01:41.2 S2: and

0:01:41.5 S2: they

0:01:41.8 S2: didn't

0:01:42.1 S2: know

0:01:42.2 S2: what

0:01:42.3 S2: was

0:01:42.5 S2: going

0:01:42.7 S2: on

0:01:43.1 S2: but

0:01:43.4 S2: stayed

0:01:43.9 S2: there

0:01:44.3 S2: without

0:01:44.6 S2: running

0:01:44.8 S2: away.

0:01:46.5 S2: Until

0:01:47.5 S2: finally,

0:01:48.1 S2: the

0:01:48.2 S2: box

0:01:49.3 S2: spit

0:01:49.4 S2: out

0:01:50.4 S2: a

0:01:50.9 S2: map,

0:01:51.3 S2: and

0:01:51.7 S2: the

0:01:52.2 S2: map

0:01:52.6 S2: was

0:01:53.0 S2: the

0:01:53.3 S2: location

0:01:54.3 S2: of

0:01:54.4 S2: where

0:01:55.0 S2: the

0:01:55.2 S2: real

0:01:55.5 S2: aliens

0:01:57.0 S2: had

0:01:57.9 S2: teleported.

0:02:00.5 S1: They

0:02:01.4 S1: wanted

0:02:01.7 S1: to

0:02:01.8 S1: follow

0:02:02.1 S1: the

0:02:02.3 S1: map

0:02:02.5 S1: to

0:02:02.6 S1: find

0:02:02.8 S1: out

0:02:03.0 S1: where

0:02:03.2 S1: the

0:02:03.3 S1: other

0:02:03.5 S1: aliens

0:02:04.0 S1: were,

0:02:04.3 S1: but

0:02:04.5 S1: the

0:02:04.6 S1: teacher

0:02:05.0 S1: suggested

0:02:05.5 S1: that

0:02:05.6 S1: they

0:02:05.8 S1: get

0:02:06.0 S1: into

0:02:06.2 S1: the

0:02:06.3 S1: bus

0:02:06.5 S1: immediately

0:02:07.1 S1: and

0:02:07.3 S1: leave.

0:02:08.2 S1: They

0:02:08.4 S1: didn't

0:02:08.6 S1: want

0:02:08.8 S1: to,

0:02:09.6 S1: so

0:02:09.8 S1: one

0:02:09.9 S1: of

0:02:10.0 S1: the

0:02:10.2 S1: brave

0:02:10.5 S1: students

0:02:11.0 S1: approached

0:02:11.6 S1: the

0:02:11.8 S1: original

0:02:12.4 S1: alien,

0:02:12.9 S1: the

0:02:13.1 S1: being,

0:02:14.8 S1: and

0:02:15.0 S1: tried

0:02:15.3 S1: to

0:02:15.5 S1: communicate

0:02:16.0 S1: with

0:02:16.1 S1: it.

0:02:16.4 S1: The

0:02:16.8 S1: student

0:02:17.5 S1: slowly

0:02:18.1 S1: crept

0:02:18.5 S1: towards

0:02:18.9 S1: the

0:02:19.0 S1: being,

0:02:20.3 S1: more

0:02:20.5 S1: purple

0:02:21.0 S1: smoke

0:02:21.3 S1: came

0:02:21.5 S1: out,

0:02:21.9 S1: they

0:02:22.0 S1: decided

0:02:22.4 S1: that

0:02:22.6 S1: the

0:02:22.7 S1: purple

0:02:23.1 S1: smoke

0:02:23.3 S1: was

0:02:23.5 S1: coming

0:02:23.8 S1: from

0:02:24.0 S1: the

0:02:24.1 S1: alien.

0:02:25.2 S1: He

0:02:25.4 S1: said,

0:02:25.6 S1: "Hello,"

0:02:26.0 S2: He

0:02:26.8 S2: said,

0:02:28.1 S2: "Hello,"

0:02:29.5 S2: because

0:02:29.9 S2: the

0:02:30.2 S2: box

0:02:31.1 S2: head

0:02:32.3 S2: transformed

0:02:34.8 S2: again,

0:02:36.3 S2: because

0:02:36.4 S2: it

0:02:36.4 S2: turns

0:02:36.4 S2: out

0:02:36.5 S2: that

0:02:36.6 S2: these

0:02:36.8 S2: aliens

0:02:37.3 S2: can

0:02:37.4 S2: actually

0:02:37.9 S2: shapeshift.

0:02:39.6 S2: And

0:02:40.1 S2: now,

0:02:40.9 S2: it

0:02:41.1 S2: had

0:02:41.7 S2: shifted

0:02:42.3 S2: into

0:02:42.5 S2: the

0:02:42.7 S2: form

0:02:43.2 S2: of

0:02:43.5 S2: a

0:02:43.7 S2: human

0:02:44.2 S2: and

0:02:44.4 S2: it

0:02:44.6 S2: looked

0:02:45.4 S2: just

0:02:45.5 S2: like

0:02:45.6 S2: them

0:02:46.1 S2: and

0:02:46.5 S2: sounded

0:02:47.1 S2: just

0:02:47.3 S2: like

0:02:47.5 S2: them

0:02:48.1 S2: and

0:02:48.6 S2: spoke

0:02:48.8 S2: like

0:02:49.0 S2: them.

0:02:50.3 S2: And

0:02:50.4 S2: they

0:02:50.6 S2: couldn't

0:02:50.8 S2: tell

0:02:51.0 S2: the

0:02:51.1 S2: difference.

0:02:51.5 S2: And

0:02:51.7 S2: they

0:02:51.8 S2: said,

0:02:52.9 S2: "What

0:02:53.1 S2: are

0:02:53.3 S2: you?

0:02:54.1 S2: How

0:02:54.3 S2: did

0:02:54.4 S2: you

0:02:54.6 S2: get

0:02:55.4 S2: here?"

0:03:00.5 S1: The

0:02:57.4 S1: alien

0:02:58.6 S1: said

0:02:59.7 S1: he

0:03:00.3 S1: was

0:03:01.0 S1: from

0:03:01.2 S1: the

0:03:01.4 S1: planet

0:03:01.8 S1: Mavenchka.

0:03:02.4 S1: He

0:03:02.7 S1: had

0:03:02.9 S1: traveled

0:03:04.2 S1: years

0:03:04.4 S1: and

0:03:04.6 S1: years,

0:03:05.1 S1: light

0:03:05.7 S1: years

0:03:06.7 S1: to

0:03:06.9 S1: the

0:03:07.0 S1: planet

0:03:07.3 S1: Earth

0:03:08.0 S1: to

0:03:08.2 S1: see

0:03:08.4 S1: what

0:03:08.5 S1: other

0:03:08.8 S1: life

0:03:09.0 S1: forms

0:03:09.3 S1: there

0:03:09.5 S1: were,

0:03:09.9 S1: and

0:03:10.0 S1: he

0:03:10.1 S1: was

0:03:10.3 S1: thrilled

0:03:10.7 S1: to

0:03:10.8 S1: find

0:03:11.2 S1: that

0:03:11.4 S1: he

0:03:11.5 S1: could

0:03:11.7 S1: mimic

0:03:12.1 S1: their

0:03:12.4 S1: behaviors.

0:03:14.1 S1: He

0:03:14.3 S1: somehow

0:03:14.7 S1: learned

0:03:14.9 S1: English

0:03:15.3 S1: instantly,

0:03:17.3 S1: and

0:03:17.5 S1: wondered

0:03:17.8 S1: what

0:03:18.1 S1: he

0:03:18.2 S1: should

0:03:18.5 S1: ask

0:03:18.7 S1: the

0:03:19.0 S1: students.

0:03:19.7 S1: The

0:03:20.0 S1: students

0:03:20.6 S1: all

0:03:20.9 S1: had

0:03:21.0 S1: questions

0:03:21.4 S1: at

0:03:21.6 S1: once,

0:03:22.4 S1: "How

0:03:22.6 S1: old

0:03:22.9 S1: are

0:03:23.1 S1: you?

0:03:23.3 S1: Do

0:03:23.7 S1: you

0:03:24.2 S1: have

0:03:24.8 S1: parents?

0:03:25.5 S1: Are

0:03:25.7 S1: there

0:03:25.9 S1: more?"

0:03:26.3 S2: The

0:03:27.6 S2: alien

0:03:29.4 S2: said,

0:03:30.7 S2: "My

0:03:31.7 S2: name

0:03:31.9 S2: is

0:03:32.2 S2: Tom,

0:03:32.6 S2: I'm

0:03:34.3 S2: 732

0:03:35.7 S2: million

0:03:36.0 S2: years

0:03:36.2 S2: old,

0:03:37.7 S2: and

0:03:39.4 S2: I

0:03:39.6 S2: came

0:03:40.3 S2: into

0:03:40.9 S2: existence

0:03:42.2 S2: through

0:03:43.3 S2: budding.

0:03:44.3 S2: And

0:03:44.9 S2: so

0:03:45.2 S2: I

0:03:45.5 S2: don't

0:03:46.3 S2: have

0:03:46.9 S2: parents,

0:03:48.0 S2: I

0:03:48.2 S2: just

0:03:48.8 S2: have

0:03:48.9 S2: other

0:03:49.3 S2: mes.

0:03:49.8 S2: And

0:03:50.4 S2: on

0:03:50.7 S2: my

0:03:50.9 S2: planet,

0:03:51.3 S2: there's

0:03:52.1 S2: billions

0:03:52.9 S2: of

0:03:53.1 S2: Toms,

0:03:53.5 S2: and

0:03:53.7 S2: they

0:03:53.9 S2: can

0:03:54.1 S2: be

0:03:54.2 S2: whatever

0:03:54.6 S2: shape

0:03:54.9 S2: or

0:03:55.0 S2: from

0:03:55.5 S2: that

0:03:55.9 S2: they

0:03:56.1 S2: want.

0:03:58.2 S1: The

0:03:57.9 S1: alien

0:03:59.1 S1: went

0:03:60.0 S1: on

0:04:00.2 S1: to

0:04:00.3 S1: explain

0:04:00.9 S1: that

0:04:01.9 S1: he

0:04:02.2 S1: liked

0:04:02.5 S1: that

0:04:02.6 S1: they

0:04:02.8 S1: can

0:04:02.9 S1: all

0:04:03.1 S1: change

0:04:03.4 S1: shapes

0:04:03.9 S1: and

0:04:04.4 S1: be

0:04:04.5 S1: whatever

0:04:04.8 S1: they

0:04:05.0 S1: wanted

0:04:05.3 S1: to

0:04:05.4 S1: be.

0:04:05.6 S1: They

0:04:05.6 S1: could

0:04:05.6 S1: take

0:04:05.6 S1: turns

0:04:05.6 S1: being

0:04:05.6 S1: the

0:04:05.8 S1: goalie

0:04:07.7 S1: when

0:04:07.8 S1: they

0:04:07.9 S1: were

0:04:08.0 S1: playing

0:04:08.4 S1: soccer,

0:04:09.5 S1: they

0:04:09.6 S1: have

0:04:09.8 S1: somehow

0:04:10.2 S1: intercepted

0:04:11.5 S1: radio

0:04:12.1 S1: waves...

0:04:12.1 S1: Television

0:04:12.6 S1: waves,

0:04:13.4 S1: and

0:04:13.5 S1: they

0:04:13.6 S1: knew

0:04:13.8 S1: what

0:04:14.0 S1: soccer

0:04:14.4 S1: was.

0:04:15.3 S1: All

0:04:15.5 S1: the

0:04:15.7 S1: kids

0:04:15.9 S1: wanted

0:04:16.2 S1: to

0:04:16.3 S1: play

0:04:16.5 S1: soccer

0:04:17.3 S1: because

0:04:17.6 S1: they

0:04:17.8 S1: figured

0:04:18.1 S1: he

0:04:18.2 S1: could

0:04:18.4 S1: transform

0:04:18.9 S1: himself

0:04:19.3 S1: into

0:04:19.6 S1: a

0:04:19.7 S1: wall

0:04:20.2 S1: or

0:04:20.4 S1: maybe

0:04:20.6 S1: even

0:04:20.8 S1: a

0:04:21.0 S1: giant

0:04:21.4 S1: foot.

0:04:22.4 S1: They

0:04:22.5 S1: were

0:04:22.7 S1: all

0:04:23.1 S1: screaming

0:04:23.4 S1: and

0:04:23.5 S1: laughing.

0:04:24.1 S1: The

0:04:24.3 S1: teacher,

0:04:25.3 S1: again,

0:04:25.7 S1: told

0:04:25.9 S1: them

0:04:26.1 S1: to

0:04:26.2 S1: get

0:04:26.4 S1: into

0:04:26.6 S1: the

0:04:26.8 S1: bus.

0:04:29.6 S2: But

0:04:29.9 S2: Tom

0:04:30.4 S2: told

0:04:30.8 S2: them,

0:04:31.1 S2: "I'm

0:04:31.6 S2: here

0:04:32.2 S2: for

0:04:32.6 S2: one

0:04:32.8 S2: reason

0:04:33.3 S2: and

0:04:33.4 S2: it's

0:04:33.5 S2: to

0:04:33.6 S2: find

0:04:33.7 S2: more

0:04:33.8 S2: Toms.

0:04:33.9 S2: You

0:04:34.0 S2: see,

0:04:34.1 S2: for

0:04:34.4 S2: millions

0:04:37.8 S2: of

0:04:38.0 S2: years,

0:04:38.5 S2: Toms

0:04:39.0 S2: from

0:04:39.4 S2: my

0:04:39.5 S2: planet

0:04:40.0 S2: have

0:04:40.2 S2: been

0:04:40.6 S2: going

0:04:40.9 S2: to

0:04:41.0 S2: other

0:04:41.3 S2: planets.

0:04:42.6 S2: Shape-

0:04:42.9 S2: shifting,

0:04:43.4 S2: appearing

0:04:43.9 S2: the

0:04:43.9 S2: appearance

0:04:47.7 S2: of

0:04:47.8 S2: what

0:04:47.8 S2: ever

0:04:47.8 S2: they

0:04:47.8 S2: inhabited

0:04:47.8 S2: it

0:04:47.8 S2: and

0:04:47.8 S2: assimilating

0:04:48.4 S2: to

0:04:48.5 S2: their

0:04:48.7 S2: culture,

0:04:49.5 S2: so

0:04:50.2 S2: there

0:04:50.4 S2: could

0:04:50.6 S2: be

0:04:50.8 S2: a

0:04:50.8 S2: lots

0:04:51.1 S2: of

0:04:51.7 S2: Toms

0:04:52.1 S2: on

0:04:52.3 S2: this

0:04:52.7 S2: Earth,

0:04:53.2 S2: who

0:04:53.6 S2: look

0:04:54.0 S2: just

0:04:54.3 S2: like

0:04:54.5 S2: you

0:04:54.8 S2: and

0:04:55.2 S2: me.

0:04:55.3 S2: Well,

0:04:55.9 S2: me

0:04:56.1 S2: currently."

0:04:56.6 S1: It

0:04:57.2 S1: turns

0:04:58.3 S1: out

0:04:58.9 S1: the

0:04:59.5 S1: aliens

0:04:59.9 S1: have

0:05:00.1 S1: an

0:05:00.3 S1: excellent

0:05:00.8 S1: sense

0:05:01.1 S1: of

0:05:01.2 S1: smell

0:05:01.4 S1: in

0:05:01.6 S1: the

0:05:01.7 S1: way

0:05:01.9 S1: that

0:05:02.1 S1: Tom

0:05:02.5 S1: could

0:05:02.7 S1: find

0:05:02.9 S1: more

0:05:03.1 S1: Toms

0:05:03.5 S1: would

0:05:03.9 S1: just

0:05:04.3 S1: sniff

0:05:04.8 S1: them

0:05:05.1 S1: out.

0:05:05.4 S1: He

0:05:05.7 S1: turns

0:05:06.1 S1: into

0:05:06.4 S1: a

0:05:06.6 S1: giant

0:05:07.0 S1: nose.

0:05:08.3 S1: The

0:05:08.5 S1: children

0:05:08.9 S1: started

0:05:09.2 S1: giggling

0:05:09.6 S1: and

0:05:09.8 S1: laughing,

0:05:10.2 S1: they

0:05:10.3 S1: thought

0:05:10.5 S1: that

0:05:10.7 S1: was

0:05:10.9 S1: funny.

0:05:12.2 S1: But

0:05:13.1 S1: as

0:05:13.7 S1: Tom

0:05:14.6 S1: went

0:05:15.5 S1: to

0:05:16.5 S1: smell

0:05:16.8 S1: around,

0:05:17.3 S1: he

0:05:17.6 S1: smelled

0:05:17.9 S1: and

0:05:18.0 S1: smelled,

0:05:18.4 S1: he

0:05:18.5 S1: got

0:05:18.6 S1: closer

0:05:19.0 S1: to

0:05:19.1 S1: a

0:05:19.3 S1: tree,

0:05:19.7 S1: and

0:05:19.8 S1: all

0:05:20.0 S1: of

0:05:20.1 S1: a

0:05:20.2 S1: sudden

0:05:20.4 S1: the

0:05:20.6 S1: tree

0:05:20.9 S1: turned

0:05:21.2 S1: into

0:05:21.5 S1: a

0:05:21.6 S1: human,

0:05:22.4 S1: he

0:05:22.6 S1: had

0:05:22.8 S1: found

0:05:23.1 S1: his

0:05:23.3 S1: first

0:05:23.7 S1: Tom.

0:05:24.1 S1: "Hello,

0:05:24.8 S1: Tom,"

0:05:25.1 S1: he

0:05:25.3 S1: said.

0:05:25.7 S1: "Hello

0:05:26.2 S1: Tom,"

0:05:26.5 S1: he

0:05:26.7 S1: replied.

0:05:29.3 S2: He

0:05:27.9 S2: immediately

0:05:30.0 S2: killed

0:05:31.1 S2: the

0:05:31.2 S2: former

0:05:31.7 S2: tree

0:05:32.7 S2: and

0:05:32.8 S2: explained

0:05:33.2 S2: to

0:05:33.4 S2: the

0:05:33.5 S2: students.

0:05:34.6 S2: He

0:05:34.8 S2: shot

0:05:35.1 S2: it

0:05:35.3 S2: with

0:05:35.6 S2: a

0:05:35.7 S2: weird

0:05:36.1 S2: zap

0:05:36.3 S2: gun

0:05:36.6 S2: and

0:05:36.8 S2: explained

0:05:37.4 S2: to

0:05:37.5 S2: the

0:05:37.6 S2: students,

0:05:38.6 S2: "Look,

0:05:39.0 S2: you

0:05:39.1 S2: all

0:05:39.5 S2: are

0:05:39.6 S2: in

0:05:39.9 S2: danger.

0:05:40.6 S2: Any

0:05:41.0 S2: of

0:05:41.2 S2: the

0:05:41.4 S2: rogue

0:05:41.8 S2: Toms

0:05:42.1 S2: who

0:05:42.3 S2: have

0:05:42.5 S2: left

our [0:05:42.7] ____

0:05:44.3 S2: planet

0:05:45.8 S2: are

0:05:46.7 S2: rogues

0:05:48.3 S2: and

0:05:48.4 S2: they

0:05:48.6 S2: seek

0:05:48.9 S2: to

0:05:49.1 S2: harm

0:05:49.4 S2: you.

0:05:49.6 S2: They

0:05:49.9 S2: could

0:05:50.3 S2: be

0:05:50.4 S2: anywhere,

0:05:51.5 S2: your

0:05:51.7 S2: teachers

0:05:52.3 S2: even,

0:05:53.1 S2: your

0:05:53.3 S2: government

0:05:53.6 S2: officials,

0:05:54.8 S2: they're

0:05:55.6 S2: aliens.

0:05:56.4 S1: The

0:05:56.8 S1: children

0:05:57.8 S1: looked

0:05:58.5 S1: around

0:05:58.8 S1: in

0:05:58.9 S1: curiosity

0:05:59.6 S1: and

0:05:59.8 S1: realized

0:06:00.1 S1: that

0:06:00.2 S1: their

0:06:00.4 S1: teacher

0:06:00.7 S1: had

0:06:00.9 S1: disappeared.

0:06:01.7 S1: "Where

0:06:02.0 S1: did

0:06:02.3 S1: she

0:06:02.6 S1: go?

0:06:02.7 S1: Why

0:06:02.9 S1: wasn't

0:06:03.2 S1: she

0:06:03.4 S1: asking

0:06:03.7 S1: them

0:06:03.9 S1: to

0:06:04.0 S1: get

0:06:04.2 S1: into

0:06:04.4 S1: the

0:06:04.5 S1: bus?"

0:06:05.2 S1: They

0:06:05.4 S1: suddenly

0:06:05.8 S1: realized

0:06:06.3 S1: that

0:06:06.6 S1: she

0:06:07.1 S1: was

0:06:07.3 S1: a

0:06:07.4 S1: Tom,

0:06:07.8 S1: they

0:06:08.3 S1: had

0:06:08.5 S1: to

0:06:08.7 S1: find

0:06:08.9 S1: her,

0:06:09.2 S1: they

0:06:09.3 S1: had

0:06:09.5 S1: to

0:06:09.8 S1: stop

0:06:10.1 S1: her

0:06:10.2 S1: from

0:06:10.5 S1: taking

0:06:10.8 S1: over

0:06:11.0 S1: their

0:06:11.2 S1: planet.

0:06:12.2 S1: They

0:06:12.4 S1: looked

0:06:12.6 S1: in

0:06:12.7 S1: the

0:06:12.8 S1: bus,

0:06:13.2 S1: they

0:06:13.3 S1: looked

0:06:13.6 S1: under

0:06:13.9 S1: the

0:06:14.0 S1: bus

0:06:15.2 S1: and

0:06:15.5 S1: Tom

0:06:16.2 S1: began

0:06:17.4 S1: to

0:06:17.7 S1: sniff.

0:06:18.0 S1: He

0:06:18.0 S1: sniffed

0:06:18.0 S1: and

0:06:18.0 S1: sniffed

0:06:18.0 S1: and

0:06:18.2 S1: he

0:06:18.4 S1: followed

0:06:18.7 S1: her

0:06:18.9 S1: trail

0:06:19.1 S1: back

0:06:19.3 S1: to

0:06:19.5 S1: the

0:06:19.6 S1: classroom.

0:06:20.6 S1: They

0:06:20.9 S1: found

0:06:21.1 S1: her

0:06:21.3 S1: under

0:06:21.5 S1: the

0:06:21.7 S1: desk.

0:06:22.2 S1: He

0:06:22.4 S1: asked

0:06:22.9 S1: her

0:06:23.4 S1: how

0:06:23.7 S1: she

0:06:23.8 S1: could

0:06:24.0 S1: do

0:06:24.1 S1: this?

0:06:24.6 S1: Why

0:06:25.4 S1: has

0:06:25.5 S1: she

0:06:25.7 S1: not

0:06:25.9 S1: told

0:06:26.0 S1: them

0:06:26.2 S1: that

0:06:26.3 S1: she

0:06:26.4 S1: was

0:06:26.5 S1: a

0:06:26.7 S1: Tom?

0:06:29.4 S2: The

0:06:30.1 S2: teacher

0:06:30.6 S2: had

0:06:30.9 S2: immediately,

0:06:33.1 S2: instead

0:06:33.5 S2: of

0:06:33.6 S2: answering

0:06:34.0 S2: any

0:06:34.2 S2: of

0:06:34.3 S2: their

0:06:34.4 S2: questions,

0:06:35.0 S2: shifted

0:06:35.9 S2: again

0:06:36.3 S2: into

0:06:37.3 S2: a

0:06:37.7 S2: giant

0:06:38.9 S2: Spider

0:06:40.3 S2: thing

0:06:41.3 S2: but

0:06:41.8 S2: it

0:06:42.0 S2: was

0:06:42.5 S2: incredibly

0:06:43.0 S2: agile

0:06:43.7 S2: and

0:06:44.1 S2: jumped

0:06:44.4 S2: around

0:06:44.8 S2: the

0:06:44.9 S2: room

0:06:45.2 S2: a

0:06:45.4 S2: lot,

0:06:45.7 S2: scared

0:06:46.1 S2: all

0:06:46.2 S2: the

0:06:46.3 S2: students,

0:06:48.1 S2: before

0:06:48.5 S2: jumping

0:06:49.1 S2: out

0:06:49.3 S2: the

0:06:49.6 S2: window.

0:06:50.1 S2: So

0:06:50.2 S2: everybody

0:06:50.5 S2: was

0:06:50.7 S2: really

0:06:51.0 S2: shook,

0:06:52.0 S2: and

0:06:54.4 S2: the

0:06:54.7 S2: original

0:06:55.2 S2: Tom

0:06:55.4 S2: that

0:06:55.5 S2: came

0:06:55.7 S2: out

0:06:55.8 S2: of

0:06:55.9 S2: the

0:06:56.0 S2: spaceship

0:06:56.3 S2: comes

0:06:56.5 S2: after

0:06:56.8 S2: it.

0:06:59.5 S1: The

0:06:59.8 S1: students

0:07:00.2 S1: knew

0:07:00.4 S1: what

0:07:00.6 S1: to

0:07:00.8 S1: do

0:07:01.7 S1: when

0:07:01.9 S1: she

0:07:02.1 S1: ran

0:07:02.3 S1: out

0:07:02.5 S1: the

0:07:02.6 S1: window,

0:07:02.9 S1: they

0:07:03.1 S1: said,

0:07:03.5 S1: "Quick,

0:07:03.9 S1: Tom,

0:07:04.4 S1: morph

0:07:05.2 S1: into

0:07:05.8 S1: a

0:07:05.9 S1: bird.

0:07:06.3 S1: You

0:07:06.9 S1: can

0:07:07.1 S1: morph

0:07:07.4 S1: into

0:07:07.7 S1: a

0:07:07.8 S1: bird

0:07:08.2 S1: to

0:07:08.3 S1: catch

0:07:08.6 S1: the

0:07:08.8 S1: spider

0:07:09.4 S1: that

0:07:09.6 S1: wriggled

0:07:10.0 S1: and

0:07:10.2 S1: jiggled

0:07:10.6 S1: and

0:07:11.1 S1: tickled

0:07:11.9 S1: inside

0:07:12.5 S1: her."

0:07:12.8 S1: We

0:07:12.9 S1: know

0:07:13.2 S1: that

0:07:13.6 S1: song,

0:07:13.8 S1: it

0:07:14.0 S1: works.

0:07:14.4 S1: Tom

0:07:14.7 S1: morphed

0:07:15.1 S1: into

0:07:15.4 S1: a

0:07:15.5 S1: bird

0:07:15.8 S1: and

0:07:16.0 S1: chased

0:07:16.4 S1: the

0:07:16.7 S1: spider.

0:07:17.1 S1: He

0:07:17.2 S1: caught

0:07:17.4 S1: up

0:07:17.6 S1: with

0:07:17.7 S1: the

0:07:17.8 S1: teacher

0:07:19.8 S1: and

0:07:20.1 S1: grabbed

0:07:20.4 S1: her

0:07:20.5 S1: with

0:07:20.6 S1: his

0:07:20.8 S1: talent

0:07:23.6 S1: and

0:07:23.9 S1: took

0:07:24.1 S1: her

0:07:24.4 S1: off

0:07:24.6 S1: into

0:07:24.9 S1: the

0:07:25.0 S1: distance,

0:07:26.1 S1: never

0:07:26.3 S1: to

0:07:26.5 S1: be

0:07:26.6 S1: seen

0:07:26.9 S1: again.

0:07:29.9 S2: The

0:07:30.0 S2: only

0:07:30.2 S2: thing

0:07:30.4 S2: that

0:07:30.5 S2: was

0:07:31.0 S2: seen,

0:07:31.3 S2: was

0:07:31.9 S2: two

0:07:32.2 S2: people.

0:07:32.7 S2: A

0:07:33.3 S2: man

0:07:34.3 S2: and

0:07:34.4 S2: a

0:07:34.5 S2: woman

0:07:35.1 S2: came

0:07:35.3 S2: back

0:07:35.4 S2: from

0:07:35.5 S2: over

0:07:35.7 S2: the

0:07:35.8 S2: hill,

0:07:36.9 S2: where

0:07:38.2 S2: the

0:07:38.8 S2: bird

0:07:39.1 S2: had

0:07:39.3 S2: taken

0:07:39.7 S2: the

0:07:40.0 S2: spider

0:07:40.4 S2: creature.

0:07:41.1 S2: And

0:07:41.3 S2: the

0:07:41.6 S2: man

0:07:41.9 S2: and

0:07:42.1 S2: woman

0:07:42.5 S2: come

0:07:42.6 S2: back

0:07:43.0 S2: and

0:07:43.4 S2: they

0:07:43.6 S2: approach

0:07:44.0 S2: students

0:07:44.4 S2: who

0:07:44.9 S2: are

0:07:45.0 S2: actually

0:07:46.4 S2: graduate

0:07:47.0 S2: students,

0:07:47.2 S2: so

0:07:47.4 S2: they're

0:07:48.1 S2: adults,

0:07:48.7 S2: and

0:07:49.1 S2: the

0:07:49.5 S2: students

0:07:50.3 S2: don't

0:07:50.8 S2: believe

0:07:51.5 S2: much

0:07:51.9 S2: of

0:07:52.1 S2: it

0:07:52.3 S2: and

0:07:52.7 S2: just

0:07:53.0 S2: carry

0:07:53.4 S2: on

0:07:53.7 S2: for

0:07:54.2 S2: months

0:07:55.0 S2: and

0:07:55.5 S2: then

0:07:56.0 S2: years.

0:08:04.0 S1: So

0:08:04.1 S1: the

0:08:04.3 S1: students

0:08:04.7 S1: decided

0:08:05.2 S1: that

0:08:05.4 S1: they

0:08:05.6 S1: needed

0:08:05.9 S1: to

0:08:06.0 S1: be

0:08:06.1 S1: researched

0:08:06.7 S1: on

0:08:06.9 S1: the

0:08:07.0 S1: Tom,

0:08:07.7 S1: several

0:08:08.0 S1: of

0:08:08.1 S1: them

0:08:08.3 S1: have

0:08:08.6 S1: switched

0:08:08.9 S1: from

0:08:09.1 S1: psychology

0:08:09.7 S1: majors

0:08:10.0 S1: to

0:08:10.2 S1: biology

0:08:10.8 S1: to

0:08:11.0 S1: try

0:08:11.1 S1: to

0:08:11.3 S1: figure

0:08:11.5 S1: out

0:08:11.7 S1: what

0:08:11.8 S1: was

0:08:12.0 S1: going

0:08:12.3 S1: on.

0:08:12.6 S1: They

0:08:13.2 S1: found

0:08:13.8 S1: some

0:08:13.9 S1: of

0:08:14.1 S1: the

0:08:14.2 S1: remains

0:08:14.5 S1: of

0:08:14.7 S1: the

0:08:14.8 S1: spider

0:08:15.6 S1: and

0:08:15.9 S1: put

0:08:16.0 S1: it

0:08:16.2 S1: into

0:08:16.6 S1: test

0:08:17.0 S1: tubes

0:08:17.3 S1: and

0:08:17.6 S1: petri

0:08:18.4 S1: dishes.

0:08:19.1 S1: The

0:08:19.3 S1: parts

0:08:19.5 S1: on

0:08:19.6 S1: the

0:08:19.8 S1: petri

0:08:20.1 S1: dishes

0:08:21.1 S1: grew

0:08:21.7 S1: into

0:08:22.1 S1: different

0:08:22.6 S1: beings,

0:08:23.6 S1: mimicking

0:08:24.9 S1: more

0:08:26.4 S1: Toms.

0:08:28.4 S2: There

0:08:28.6 S2: was

0:08:28.7 S2: one

0:08:29.0 S2: student,

0:08:29.8 S2: who

0:08:30.0 S2: became

0:08:30.2 S2: a

0:08:30.3 S2: scientist,

0:08:32.3 S2: who

0:08:33.1 S2: raised

0:08:34.4 S2: one

0:08:34.5 S2: of

0:08:34.6 S2: these

0:08:34.9 S2: Specimens

0:08:36.0 S2: through

0:08:36.2 S2: adulthood

0:08:37.0 S2: in

0:08:37.2 S2: a

0:08:37.3 S2: matter

0:08:37.5 S2: of

0:08:37.8 S2: months,

0:08:38.3 S2: because

0:08:38.8 S2: they

0:08:39.0 S2: grow

0:08:39.6 S2: through

0:08:42.2 S2: adulthood

0:08:45.1 S2: really

0:08:45.6 S2: fast,

0:08:45.6 S2: and

0:08:45.7 S2: found

0:08:45.7 S2: he

0:08:45.8 S2: was

0:08:45.8 S2: having

0:08:45.9 S2: feelings

0:08:46.0 S2: for

0:08:46.1 S2: this

0:08:47.2 S2: Specimen,

0:08:49.0 S2: romantic

0:08:49.5 S2: ones

0:08:49.7 S2: that

0:08:49.9 S2: he

0:08:50.1 S2: couldn't

0:08:50.5 S2: explain.

0:08:50.8 S2: Specimen

0:08:51.5 S2: was

0:08:51.7 S2: shaped

0:08:51.9 S2: as

0:08:52.1 S2: a

0:08:52.4 S2: female,

a [0:08:55.2] ____

0:08:56.1 S2: female

0:08:58.9 S2: as

a [0:09:00.2] ____.

0:09:00.6 S1: It

0:09:00.7 S1: was

0:09:00.9 S1: a

0:09:01.0 S1: little

0:09:01.2 S1: awkward

0:09:01.7 S1: because

0:09:02.1 S1: he

0:09:02.3 S1: had

0:09:02.5 S1: raised

0:09:02.8 S1: this

0:09:03.2 S1: being,

0:09:04.2 S1: but

0:09:04.5 S1: he

0:09:04.6 S1: decided

0:09:05.1 S1: he

0:09:05.2 S1: could

0:09:05.4 S1: separate

0:09:06.1 S1: his

0:09:06.6 S1: professional

0:09:07.2 S1: life

0:09:07.6 S1: from

0:09:07.8 S1: his

0:09:08.5 S1: home

0:09:09.4 S1: life

0:09:10.2 S1: and

0:09:10.7 S1: he

0:09:10.9 S1: proposed.

0:09:12.5 S1: He

0:09:12.7 S1: actually

0:09:13.2 S1: took

0:09:13.6 S1: the

0:09:13.8 S1: being

0:09:14.3 S1: a

0:09:14.5 S1: hike

0:09:15.0 S1: up

0:09:15.2 S1: to

0:09:15.3 S1: the

0:09:15.5 S1: top

0:09:15.7 S1: of

0:09:15.8 S1: the

0:09:15.9 S1: mountain

0:09:16.3 S1: where

0:09:16.5 S1: the

0:09:16.8 S1: spider

0:09:17.1 S1: had

0:09:17.4 S1: then

0:09:17.9 S1: left

0:09:18.2 S1: before,

0:09:21.7 S1: told

0:09:22.0 S1: about

0:09:22.3 S1: her

0:09:22.5 S1: creation

0:09:23.5 S1: and

0:09:23.8 S1: asked

0:09:24.0 S1: her

0:09:24.3 S1: to

0:09:24.4 S1: marry

0:09:26.7 S1: him.

0:09:27.8 S2: Upon

0:09:28.3 S2: hearing

0:09:29.1 S2: this,

0:09:29.7 S2: the

0:09:30.1 S2: Tom,

0:09:30.4 S2: who

0:09:30.6 S2: was

0:09:30.7 S2: going

0:09:31.0 S2: by

0:09:31.2 S2: Guinevere

0:09:31.8 S2: at

0:09:32.0 S2: the

0:09:32.1 S2: time,

0:09:33.8 S2: immediately

0:09:34.7 S2: jumped

0:09:35.2 S2: off

0:09:35.4 S2: of

0:09:35.5 S2: the

0:09:35.6 S2: cliff

0:09:35.6 S2: where

0:09:36.1 S2: they

0:09:36.2 S2: were

0:09:36.6 S2: and

0:09:37.1 S2: shifted

0:09:37.9 S2: into

0:09:38.4 S2: a

0:09:38.6 S2: bird

0:09:39.1 S2: point

0:09:39.6 S2: and

0:09:39.9 S2: ran

0:09:40.1 S2: away,

0:09:40.9 S2: or

0:09:41.1 S2: flew

0:09:41.3 S2: away.

0:09:41.8 S2: As

0:09:42.3 S2: she

0:09:43.0 S2: flew

0:09:43.8 S2: away,

0:09:44.7 S2: a

0:09:45.0 S2: single

0:09:46.1 S2: tear

0:09:47.0 S2: shed

0:09:47.8 S2: from

0:09:48.5 S2: her

0:09:48.8 S2: Tom,

0:09:49.0 S2: Guinevere,

0:09:49.3 S2: bird

0:09:49.5 S2: face,

0:09:49.7 S2: as

0:09:50.0 S2: she

0:09:51.0 S2: thought

0:09:51.2 S2: about

0:09:51.6 S2: all

0:09:51.8 S2: of

0:09:52.0 S2: the

0:09:52.1 S2: fears

0:09:52.6 S2: she

0:09:52.8 S2: had

0:09:53.0 S2: of

0:09:53.0 S2: committing

0:09:53.0 S2: to

0:09:53.0 S2: a

0:09:53.3 S2: marriage.

0:09:54.8 S1: He

0:09:55.4 S1: thought

0:09:56.7 S1: he

0:09:57.2 S1: had

0:09:57.9 S1: lost

0:09:58.8 S1: her,

0:09:59.4 S1: he

0:09:59.8 S1: sat

0:10:00.0 S1: there

0:10:00.2 S1: for

0:10:00.4 S1: quite

0:10:00.7 S1: some

0:10:01.0 S1: time

0:10:01.7 S1: deciding

0:10:02.2 S1: what

0:10:02.4 S1: to

0:10:02.5 S1: do.

0:10:03.1 S1: He

0:10:03.3 S1: didn't

0:10:03.5 S1: know

0:10:03.7 S1: if

0:10:03.9 S1: he

0:10:04.0 S1: should

0:10:04.2 S1: try

0:10:04.4 S1: to

0:10:04.5 S1: go

0:10:04.7 S1: after

0:10:05.1 S1: her,

0:10:05.5 S1: there's

0:10:06.4 S1: no

0:10:06.6 S1: way

0:10:06.8 S1: he

0:10:06.9 S1: was

0:10:07.1 S1: catching

0:10:07.4 S1: a

0:10:07.5 S1: bird,

0:10:08.0 S1: he

0:10:08.2 S1: didn't

0:10:08.4 S1: know

0:10:08.6 S1: if

0:10:08.8 S1: he

0:10:09.0 S1: should

0:10:09.3 S1: start

0:10:09.5 S1: again,

0:10:10.1 S1: could

0:10:10.3 S1: he

0:10:10.5 S1: ever

0:10:10.8 S1: have

0:10:11.0 S1: feelings

0:10:11.5 S1: for

0:10:11.7 S1: another

0:10:12.4 S1: person...

0:10:12.9 S1: Another

0:10:13.4 S1: Tom,

0:10:14.4 S1: that

0:10:14.6 S1: wasn't

0:10:15.0 S1: Guinevere

0:10:15.9 S1: or

0:10:16.1 S1: with

0:10:16.2 S1: the

0:10:16.4 S1: new

0:10:16.7 S1: Tom

0:10:17.0 S1: be

0:10:17.9 S1: the

0:10:18.0 S1: same

0:10:18.1 S1: as

0:10:18.2 S1: Guinevere?

0:10:18.3 S1: Would

0:10:18.5 S1: he

0:10:18.7 S1: be

0:10:18.8 S1: able

0:10:19.0 S1: to

0:10:19.2 S1: tell

0:10:19.4 S1: them

0:10:19.5 S1: apart?

0:10:20.7 S1: Suddenly,

0:10:21.4 S1: he

0:10:21.8 S1: saw

0:10:22.0 S1: her

0:10:22.2 S1: coming

0:10:22.5 S1: back

0:10:22.8 S1: over

0:10:23.0 S1: the

0:10:23.2 S1: horizon,

0:10:24.2 S1: he

0:10:24.4 S1: was

0:10:25.4 S1: thrilled.

0:10:27.8 S2: She

0:10:28.5 S2: decided

0:10:29.1 S2: she

0:10:29.4 S2: had

0:10:29.7 S2: nothing

0:10:29.9 S2: to

0:10:30.0 S2: lose

0:10:30.8 S2: and

0:10:31.3 S2: went

0:10:31.5 S2: ahead

0:10:32.2 S2: and

0:10:32.5 S2: married

0:10:33.5 S2: the

0:10:33.9 S2: scientist,

0:10:35.1 S2: who

0:10:35.6 S2: used

0:10:36.2 S2: to

0:10:36.4 S2: be

0:10:36.5 S2: a

0:10:36.6 S2: student.

0:10:37.9 S2: And

0:10:38.5 S2: one

0:10:39.1 S2: day,

0:10:39.7 S2: years

0:10:40.5 S2: into

0:10:40.7 S2: their

0:10:40.9 S2: marriage,

0:10:41.1 S2: they're

0:10:41.3 S2: watching

0:10:41.5 S2: the

0:10:42.1 S2: news

0:10:42.9 S2: and

0:10:43.4 S2: the

0:10:43.7 S2: government

0:10:44.4 S2: had

0:10:45.4 S2: begun

0:10:45.7 S2: a

0:10:45.8 S2: new

0:10:45.9 S2: program

0:10:46.5 S2: to

0:10:47.0 S2: identify

0:10:47.7 S2: all

0:10:48.0 S2: Toms

0:10:48.3 S2: infiltrating

0:10:49.0 S2: their

0:10:49.3 S2: society

0:10:50.2 S2: and

0:10:50.4 S2: totally

0:10:50.8 S2: penalize

0:10:51.6 S2: these

0:10:52.1 S2: aliens

0:10:52.7 S2: as

0:10:53.0 S2: foreign

0:10:53.7 S2: and

0:10:54.0 S2: came

0:10:54.4 S2: up

0:10:54.7 S2: with

0:10:55.1 S2: a

0:10:55.2 S2: systematic

0:10:55.7 S2: way

0:10:56.0 S2: to...

0:11:00.8 S1: They

0:11:01.0 S1: didn't

0:11:01.3 S1: know

0:11:01.5 S1: about

0:11:01.9 S1: sniffing

0:11:02.8 S1: out

0:11:03.2 S1: Toms,

0:11:03.5 S1: that

0:11:03.7 S1: they

0:11:04.0 S1: each

0:11:04.1 S1: had

0:11:04.4 S1: the

0:11:04.6 S1: ability

0:11:05.1 S1: to

0:11:05.3 S1: find

0:11:05.6 S1: another

0:11:06.1 S1: Tom

0:11:06.6 S1: themselves,

0:11:07.9 S1: and

0:11:08.2 S1: said

0:11:08.8 S1: they

0:11:09.0 S1: decided

0:11:09.5 S1: to

0:11:09.9 S1: form

0:11:10.2 S1: a

0:11:10.3 S1: search

0:11:10.6 S1: party,

0:11:10.9 S1: the

0:11:11.2 S1: scientists

0:11:11.9 S1: didn't

0:11:12.2 S1: know

0:11:12.3 S1: exactly

0:11:12.8 S1: what

0:11:12.9 S1: they

0:11:13.1 S1: were

0:11:13.2 S1: doing,

0:11:13.5 S1: but

0:11:13.7 S1: they

0:11:13.8 S1: were

0:11:14.0 S1: determined.

0:11:15.8 S1: The

0:11:16.0 S1: student

0:11:16.4 S1: and

0:11:16.6 S1: Guinevere

0:11:17.2 S1: decide

0:11:17.7 S1: that

0:11:17.9 S1: they

0:11:18.1 S1: would

0:11:18.3 S1: either

0:11:18.5 S1: have

0:11:18.7 S1: to

0:11:18.8 S1: hide

0:11:19.4 S1: or

0:11:19.7 S1: potentially

0:11:20.5 S1: leave

0:11:20.9 S1: the

0:11:21.0 S1: planet.

0:11:22.0 S1: They

0:11:22.1 S1: thought

0:11:22.3 S1: that

0:11:22.5 S1: they

0:11:22.6 S1: would

0:11:22.8 S1: try

0:11:23.0 S1: to

0:11:23.1 S1: stay,

0:11:23.4 S1: they

0:11:23.6 S1: liked

0:11:23.9 S1: their

0:11:24.1 S1: life

0:11:24.4 S1: here,

0:11:25.1 S1: and

0:11:25.2 S1: came

0:11:25.4 S1: up

0:11:25.6 S1: with

0:11:25.7 S1: a

0:11:25.8 S1: way

0:11:26.0 S1: to

0:11:26.2 S1: cover

0:11:26.5 S1: up

0:11:26.9 S1: her

0:11:27.5 S1: identity.

0:11:28.9 S2: But

0:11:29.3 S2: the

0:11:29.5 S2: government

0:11:30.1 S2: was

0:11:30.7 S2: relentless,

0:11:31.9 S2: they

0:11:32.1 S2: spent

0:11:32.4 S2: billions

0:11:32.8 S2: of

0:11:33.0 S2: dollars

0:11:33.8 S2: hiring

0:11:34.3 S2: teams

0:11:35.8 S2: of

0:11:36.5 S2: officials

0:11:37.4 S2: who

0:11:37.6 S2: were

0:11:38.7 S2: breaking

0:11:39.1 S2: into

0:11:39.5 S2: schools,

0:11:40.4 S2: and

0:11:40.8 S2: administrating

0:11:42.4 S2: testing

0:11:43.3 S2: in

0:11:43.6 S2: airports,

0:11:44.5 S2: it

0:11:44.6 S2: was

0:11:44.8 S2: just

0:11:45.1 S2: a

0:11:45.3 S2: witch-

0:11:45.6 S2: hunt

0:11:45.8 S2: for

0:11:46.0 S2: these

0:11:46.2 S2: aliens.

0:11:48.1 S2: But

0:11:49.2 S2: the

0:11:49.5 S2: scientist,

0:11:50.1 S2: who's

0:11:50.5 S2: name

0:11:50.9 S2: was

0:11:51.1 S2: Bill,

0:11:51.5 S2: and

0:11:51.8 S2: Guinevere,

0:11:52.4 S2: felt

0:11:52.8 S2: real

0:11:53.1 S2: love

0:11:53.4 S2: for

0:11:54.2 S2: one

0:11:54.3 S2: another.

0:11:56.7 S2: They

0:11:57.6 S2: decided

0:11:59.6 S2: to

0:11:59.8 S2: move

0:12:00.0 S2: to

0:12:00.2 S2: a

0:12:00.3 S2: different

0:12:00.6 S2: country,

0:12:01.7 S2: one

0:12:02.3 S2: that

0:12:02.8 S2: was

0:12:03.1 S2: less

0:12:03.3 S2: into

0:12:03.7 S2: science

0:12:04.1 S2: where

0:12:04.3 S2: they

0:12:04.5 S2: might

0:12:04.7 S2: be

0:12:04.9 S2: able

0:12:05.1 S2: to

0:12:05.3 S2: live

0:12:05.8 S2: in

0:12:05.9 S2: a

0:12:06.7 S2: cabin

0:12:07.2 S2: or

0:12:07.4 S2: a

0:12:07.5 S2: straw

0:12:07.8 S2: hut

0:12:08.4 S2: for

0:12:08.6 S2: a

0:12:08.7 S2: while,

0:12:09.2 S2: live

0:12:09.4 S2: off

0:12:09.6 S2: the

0:12:09.7 S2: lands.

0:12:10.9 S2: They

0:12:11.1 S2: moved

0:12:11.3 S2: there,

0:12:13.5 S2: they

0:12:13.7 S2: got

0:12:13.9 S2: some

0:12:14.3 S2: pets,

0:12:15.7 S2: no

0:12:16.0 S2: spiders

0:12:16.4 S2: though,

0:12:16.9 S2: that

0:12:17.1 S2: was

0:12:17.2 S2: a

0:12:17.3 S2: bad

0:12:17.6 S2: memory.

0:12:20.2 S2: They

0:12:20.4 S2: made

0:12:20.6 S2: friends

0:12:20.9 S2: with

0:12:21.1 S2: the

0:12:21.2 S2: locals,

0:12:22.0 S2: they

0:12:22.2 S2: started

0:12:22.6 S2: a

0:12:22.7 S2: school

0:12:23.8 S2: to

0:12:23.9 S2: educate

0:12:24.4 S2: the

0:12:24.6 S2: people

0:12:24.9 S2: there

0:12:25.5 S2: about

0:12:25.9 S2: who

0:12:26.1 S2: they

0:12:26.3 S2: are

0:12:26.6 S2: and

0:12:26.7 S2: where

0:12:26.9 S2: they

0:12:27.0 S2: came

0:12:27.2 S2: from.

0:12:29.6 S2: There

0:12:29.8 S2: was

0:12:30.2 S2: trouble

0:12:30.5 S2: in

0:12:30.6 S2: paradise.

0:12:31.3 S2: Guinevere

0:12:33.5 S2: and

0:12:34.5 S2: Bill

0:12:35.6 S2: expensively

0:12:38.1 S2: we're

0:12:38.3 S2: living

0:12:38.6 S2: a

0:12:38.7 S2: good

0:12:39.0 S2: life,

0:12:40.6 S2: but

0:12:40.9 S2: there

0:12:41.1 S2: was

0:12:41.2 S2: an

0:12:41.4 S2: urge

0:12:41.9 S2: in

0:12:42.3 S2: Guinevere/Tom

0:12:44.4 S2: to

0:12:44.7 S2: be

0:12:45.1 S2: with

0:12:45.7 S2: people

0:12:46.0 S2: of

0:12:46.5 S2: her

0:12:46.8 S2: own

0:12:47.1 S2: kind,

0:12:48.1 S2: there

0:12:48.3 S2: was

0:12:48.6 S2: just

0:12:48.6 S2: something

0:12:49.3 S2: different

0:12:49.9 S2: and

0:12:50.9 S2: she

0:12:51.4 S2: wanted

0:12:51.6 S2: to

0:12:51.7 S2: find

0:12:52.8 S2: other

0:12:53.9 S2: Toms.

0:12:54.3 S2: They

0:12:54.6 S2: spoke

0:12:55.0 S2: about

0:12:55.3 S2: it.

0:12:58.2 S1: She

0:12:58.4 S1: started

0:12:58.7 S1: to

0:12:58.9 S1: cry,

0:12:59.3 S1: she

0:12:59.5 S1: felt

0:12:59.8 S1: terrible

0:13:00.2 S1: that

0:13:00.4 S1: she

0:13:00.6 S1: would

0:13:00.7 S1: do

0:13:00.9 S1: this

0:13:01.0 S1: to

0:13:01.2 S1: Bill,

0:13:01.5 S1: she

0:13:01.8 S1: did

0:13:02.0 S1: loved

0:13:02.4 S1: him,

0:13:02.7 S1: but

0:13:02.9 S1: it

0:13:03.0 S1: wasn't

0:13:03.3 S1: enough.

0:13:04.7 S1: She

0:13:04.9 S1: decided

0:13:05.3 S1: that

0:13:05.6 S1: she

0:13:05.8 S1: would

0:13:06.9 S1: go

0:13:07.1 S1: back

0:13:07.4 S1: to

0:13:07.5 S1: her

0:13:07.7 S1: planet,

0:13:08.3 S1: although

0:13:09.1 S1: she

0:13:09.2 S1: didn't

0:13:09.5 S1: know

0:13:09.7 S1: where

0:13:09.8 S1: it

0:13:09.9 S1: was,

0:13:10.2 S1: she

0:13:10.4 S1: had

0:13:10.6 S1: been

0:13:10.8 S1: created

0:13:11.3 S1: here

0:13:11.8 S1: and

0:13:12.4 S1: brought

0:13:12.7 S1: up

0:13:12.9 S1: here,

0:13:13.9 S1: and

0:13:14.1 S1: she

0:13:14.3 S1: needed

0:13:14.5 S1: to

0:13:14.7 S1: find

0:13:14.9 S1: someone

0:13:15.2 S1: else

0:13:15.5 S1: who

0:13:16.1 S1: knew.

0:13:16.8 S1: Bill

0:13:17.6 S1: decided

0:13:18.7 S1: that

0:13:18.9 S1: he

0:13:19.0 S1: would

0:13:19.2 S1: have

0:13:19.4 S1: to

0:13:19.5 S1: let

0:13:19.7 S1: her

0:13:19.8 S1: go.

0:13:20.4 S1: From

0:13:20.7 S1: his

0:13:21.1 S1: pocket,

0:13:21.6 S1: he

0:13:21.8 S1: took

0:13:22.1 S1: a

0:13:22.2 S1: piece

0:13:22.4 S1: of

0:13:22.6 S1: paper,

0:13:23.5 S1: it

0:13:23.7 S1: was

0:13:23.9 S1: the

0:13:24.0 S1: map.

0:13:24.2 S1: She

0:13:24.3 S1: had

0:13:24.5 S1: never

0:13:26.1 S1: seen

0:13:26.4 S1: it

0:13:26.5 S1: before,

0:13:28.5 S1: she

0:13:29.3 S1: vaguely

0:13:30.8 S1: recognized

0:13:31.4 S1: some

0:13:31.6 S1: of

0:13:31.7 S1: the

0:13:31.8 S1: symbols

0:13:32.1 S1: on

0:13:32.3 S1: it,

0:13:32.5 S1: but

0:13:32.7 S1: they

0:13:32.9 S1: were

0:13:35.1 S1: symbols

0:13:35.4 S1: on

0:13:35.6 S1: the

0:13:35.9 S1: map

0:13:36.0 S1: were

0:13:36.2 S1: written

0:13:36.6 S1: in

0:13:36.7 S1: her

0:13:37.3 S1: original

0:13:38.0 S1: Tom

0:13:38.3 S1: language,

0:13:38.9 S1: which

0:13:39.3 S1: she

0:13:39.5 S1: wasn't

0:13:40.0 S1: as

0:13:40.2 S1: fluent

0:13:40.7 S1: in

0:13:40.8 S1: anymore,

0:13:41.3 S1: she's

0:13:41.6 S1: been

0:13:41.8 S1: speaking

0:13:42.3 S1: English

0:13:42.7 S1: for

0:13:42.9 S1: a

0:13:42.9 S1: while.

0:13:44.2 S1: But

0:13:44.8 S1: something

0:13:45.3 S1: inside

0:13:46.0 S1: her

0:13:46.3 S1: recognized

0:13:47.2 S1: the

0:13:47.4 S1: symbols

0:13:48.1 S1: as

0:13:48.4 S1: a

0:13:48.5 S1: way

0:13:48.8 S1: to

0:13:48.9 S1: get

0:13:49.1 S1: home.

0:13:49.5 S1: So

0:13:50.1 S1: she

0:13:50.9 S1: began

0:13:52.1 S1: to

0:13:52.7 S1: follow

0:13:54.0 S1: that

0:13:56.8 S1: map.

0:13:58.3 S1: It

0:13:58.4 S1: was

0:13:58.6 S1: a

0:13:58.7 S1: challenge

0:13:59.2 S1: because

0:13:59.5 S1: she

0:13:59.7 S1: didn't

0:14:00.0 S1: speak

0:14:00.3 S1: Tommies

0:14:01.5 S1: fluently,

0:14:02.8 S1: she

0:14:02.9 S1: decided

0:14:03.4 S1: that

0:14:03.8 S1: she

0:14:04.0 S1: would

0:14:04.2 S1: just

0:14:04.3 S1: do

0:14:04.5 S1: the

0:14:04.6 S1: best

0:14:05.0 S1: club

0:14:05.4 S1: and

0:14:05.5 S1: hopefully

0:14:06.0 S1: she

0:14:06.1 S1: would

0:14:06.3 S1: find

0:14:06.5 S1: someone

0:14:06.8 S1: along

0:14:07.1 S1: the

0:14:07.2 S1: way,

0:14:07.5 S1: another

0:14:08.0 S1: Tom,

0:14:08.3 S1: or

0:14:08.6 S1: many

0:14:08.8 S1: multiple

0:14:09.3 S1: Toms

0:14:10.1 S1: to

0:14:10.2 S1: ask

0:14:10.7 S1: what

0:14:10.9 S1: to

0:14:11.0 S1: do.

0:14:12.5 S1: She

0:14:12.8 S1: morphed

0:14:13.1 S1: into

0:14:13.4 S1: a

0:14:13.6 S1: spaceship,

0:14:14.4 S1: first

0:14:14.9 S1: a

0:14:15.0 S1: cube,

0:14:15.3 S1: and

0:14:15.5 S1: then

0:14:15.7 S1: folded

0:14:16.0 S1: up

0:14:16.1 S1: her

0:14:16.3 S1: legs

0:14:16.7 S1: into

0:14:17.0 S1: a

0:14:17.1 S1: triangle.

0:14:19.1 S1: It

0:14:19.2 S1: was

0:14:19.3 S1: an

0:14:19.5 S1: upside-

0:14:19.9 S1: down

0:14:20.1 S1: pyramid

0:14:20.8 S1: and

0:14:21.0 S1: it

0:14:21.2 S1: blasted

0:14:21.7 S1: off.

0:14:22.3 S1: Bill

0:14:22.6 S1: watched

0:14:22.9 S1: from

0:14:23.1 S1: afar

0:14:23.4 S1: with

0:14:23.7 S1: a

0:14:24.0 S1: single

0:14:24.3 S1: tear

0:14:24.7 S1: sliding

0:14:25.2 S1: down

0:14:25.4 S1: his

0:14:25.6 S1: face.

0:14:27.6 S2: And

0:14:27.9 S2: then

0:14:28.1 S2: decided,

0:14:29.2 S2: "I

0:14:29.5 S2: can't

0:14:29.8 S2: have

0:14:30.0 S2: Guinevere,

0:14:30.7 S2: then

0:14:31.1 S2: one

0:14:31.3 S2: will."

0:14:31.6 S2: He

0:14:32.1 S2: thinks

0:14:33.2 S2: quickly

0:14:33.5 S2: about

0:14:33.7 S2: what

0:14:33.8 S2: to

0:14:34.0 S2: do

0:14:34.4 S2: as

0:14:34.8 S2: the

0:14:35.1 S2: ship

0:14:35.9 S2: is

0:14:36.4 S2: beginning

0:14:38.1 S2: to

0:14:38.6 S2: fly

0:14:39.3 S2: off

0:14:39.8 S2: and

0:14:40.5 S2: grabs

0:14:41.0 S2: this

0:14:41.3 S2: giant

0:14:42.2 S2: experimental

0:14:44.4 S2: Bazooka

0:14:46.4 S2: from

0:14:46.7 S2: his

0:14:47.5 S2: old

0:14:47.8 S2: lab.

0:14:50.6 S2: He's
