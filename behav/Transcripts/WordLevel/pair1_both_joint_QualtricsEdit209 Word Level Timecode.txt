0:00:01.0 S1: Okay,

0:00:01.6 S1: it's

0:00:01.7 S1: my

0:00:01.9 S1: turn.

0:00:02.9 S1: So

0:00:03.1 S1: there's

0:00:03.6 S1: this

0:00:04.0 S1: kid

0:00:04.2 S1: named

0:00:04.6 S1: Billy,

0:00:04.9 S1: and

0:00:05.7 S1: he's

0:00:05.9 S1: on

0:00:06.0 S1: his

0:00:06.2 S1: way

0:00:06.5 S1: to

0:00:06.8 S1: school

0:00:07.9 S1: and

0:00:08.9 S1: it's

0:00:09.1 S1: a

0:00:09.2 S1: long

0:00:09.5 S1: way.

0:00:09.7 S1: It's

0:00:09.9 S1: about

0:00:10.1 S1: a

0:00:10.2 S1: couple

0:00:10.4 S1: of

0:00:10.6 S1: miles

0:00:12.2 S1: and

0:00:12.3 S1: normally

0:00:12.8 S1: this

0:00:13.0 S1: is

0:00:13.1 S1: an

0:00:13.3 S1: uneventful

0:00:14.0 S1: trip.

0:00:14.4 S1: And

0:00:14.6 S1: he's

0:00:14.8 S1: walking

0:00:15.3 S1: to

0:00:15.5 S1: school,

0:00:16.6 S1: and

0:00:16.8 S1: he

0:00:17.0 S1: comes

0:00:17.3 S1: across

0:00:17.7 S1: a

0:00:17.9 S1: dog

0:00:18.9 S1: and

0:00:19.1 S1: the

0:00:19.2 S1: dog

0:00:19.5 S1: seems

0:00:19.7 S1: to

0:00:19.9 S1: be

0:00:20.0 S1: lost.

0:00:21.6 S1: And

0:00:21.8 S1: he

0:00:21.9 S1: tries

0:00:22.2 S1: to

0:00:22.3 S1: find

0:00:22.7 S1: out

0:00:22.9 S1: whether

0:00:23.2 S1: there's

0:00:23.5 S1: a

0:00:23.7 S1: tag

0:00:24.1 S1: on

0:00:24.2 S1: the

0:00:24.3 S1: dog

0:00:24.7 S1: to

0:00:24.9 S1: tell

0:00:25.3 S1: him

0:00:25.6 S1: who

0:00:25.9 S1: his

0:00:26.1 S1: owner

0:00:26.5 S1: is,

0:00:27.0 S1: but

0:00:27.1 S1: there's

0:00:27.4 S1: no

0:00:27.6 S1: tag.

0:00:28.8 S1: And

0:00:29.0 S1: so...

0:00:31.5 S2: Billy

0:00:31.9 S2: continued

0:00:32.5 S2: walking

0:00:32.9 S2: to

0:00:33.1 S2: school,

0:00:33.8 S2: and

0:00:34.1 S2: the

0:00:34.3 S2: dog

0:00:35.0 S2: started

0:00:35.4 S2: to

0:00:35.5 S2: follow

0:00:35.9 S2: him.

0:00:37.4 S2: The

0:00:37.6 S2: dog

0:00:38.0 S2: followed

0:00:38.4 S2: him

0:00:40.1 S2: over

0:00:40.4 S2: a

0:00:40.8 S2: hill

0:00:41.6 S2: and

0:00:42.5 S2: into

0:00:43.2 S2: the

0:00:43.4 S2: town

0:00:44.0 S2: where

0:00:44.2 S2: the

0:00:44.4 S2: school

0:00:44.7 S2: was.

0:00:47.0 S2: And

0:00:49.8 S2: it

0:00:50.0 S2: kept

0:00:50.2 S2: on

0:00:50.6 S2: barking

0:00:51.0 S2: and

0:00:51.2 S2: yapping

0:00:51.7 S2: and

0:00:52.1 S2: nipping

0:00:52.4 S2: at

0:00:52.6 S2: Billy's

0:00:53.0 S2: heels

0:00:54.1 S2: until

0:00:54.5 S2: they

0:00:54.7 S2: got

0:00:55.0 S2: to

0:00:55.4 S2: the

0:00:55.7 S2: schoolhouse.

0:00:57.7 S2: When

0:00:57.9 S2: they

0:00:58.1 S2: arrived...

0:01:00.0 S1: The

0:01:00.2 S1: principal

0:01:00.7 S1: said,

0:01:01.4 S1: "You

0:01:01.6 S1: can't

0:01:01.9 S1: bring

0:01:02.1 S1: a

0:01:02.3 S1: dog

0:01:02.6 S1: in

0:01:02.8 S1: here.

0:01:03.7 S1: There

0:01:03.8 S1: are

0:01:03.9 S1: no

0:01:04.1 S1: dogs

0:01:04.4 S1: allowed

0:01:04.8 S1: in

0:01:04.9 S1: the

0:01:05.1 S1: school

0:01:05.6 S1: unless

0:01:05.9 S1: this

0:01:06.1 S1: is

0:01:06.2 S1: a

0:01:06.4 S1: seeing-

0:01:06.8 S1: eye

0:01:07.3 S1: dog.

0:01:07.8 S1: But

0:01:08.0 S1: Billy,

0:01:08.7 S1: since

0:01:09.0 S1: you

0:01:09.1 S1: are

0:01:09.2 S1: not

0:01:09.5 S1: blind,

0:01:10.7 S1: and

0:01:10.8 S1: this

0:01:10.9 S1: is

0:01:11.1 S1: not

0:01:11.4 S1: an

0:01:11.5 S1: emotional

0:01:12.1 S1: support

0:01:13.3 S1: dog,

0:01:13.7 S1: he

0:01:13.9 S1: is

0:01:14.1 S1: not

0:01:14.3 S1: allowed

0:01:14.7 S1: in

0:01:14.9 S1: the

0:01:15.1 S1: school."

0:01:16.2 S1: Billy

0:01:16.4 S1: looked

0:01:16.7 S1: at

0:01:16.8 S1: the

0:01:17.0 S1: dog

0:01:17.4 S1: and

0:01:17.5 S1: the

0:01:17.7 S1: dog

0:01:18.2 S1: looked

0:01:18.4 S1: at

0:01:18.6 S1: Billy,

0:01:19.7 S1: and

0:01:19.8 S1: the

0:01:20.0 S1: dog

0:01:20.2 S1: looked

0:01:20.5 S1: very

0:01:20.9 S1: sad.

0:01:21.3 S1: And

0:01:21.8 S1: so

0:01:22.1 S1: Billy

0:01:22.7 S1: decided

0:01:23.9 S1: that

0:01:24.1 S1: he

0:01:24.2 S1: would

0:01:24.4 S1: somehow

0:01:25.0 S1: find

0:01:25.3 S1: a

0:01:25.4 S1: way

0:01:25.9 S1: to

0:01:26.0 S1: get

0:01:26.1 S1: the

0:01:26.3 S1: dog

0:01:26.7 S1: into

0:01:27.0 S1: the

0:01:27.2 S1: school.

0:01:28.4 S1: And

0:01:28.6 S1: so...

0:01:30.8 S2: Billy

0:01:31.1 S2: walked

0:01:31.4 S2: around

0:01:31.7 S2: the

0:01:31.9 S2: back

0:01:32.1 S2: of

0:01:32.2 S2: the

0:01:32.3 S2: school

0:01:32.8 S2: to

0:01:32.9 S2: where

0:01:33.0 S2: the

0:01:33.2 S2: dumpsters

0:01:33.7 S2: were,

0:01:34.4 S2: and

0:01:34.6 S2: the

0:01:34.8 S2: little

0:01:35.0 S2: dog

0:01:35.3 S2: followed

0:01:35.7 S2: him.

0:01:37.2 S2: When

0:01:37.4 S2: they

0:01:37.6 S2: got

0:01:37.8 S2: there,

0:01:38.2 S2: Billy

0:01:38.7 S2: petted

0:01:39.3 S2: the

0:01:39.6 S2: dog

0:01:39.9 S2: and

0:01:40.2 S2: it

0:01:40.4 S2: calms

0:01:40.8 S2: down,

0:01:41.7 S2: and

0:01:41.9 S2: then

0:01:42.1 S2: he

0:01:42.4 S2: slipped

0:01:42.6 S2: the

0:01:42.8 S2: dog

0:01:43.2 S2: into

0:01:43.7 S2: his

0:01:44.0 S2: backpack.

0:01:45.1 S2: The

0:01:45.6 S2: dog

0:01:46.0 S2: looked

0:01:46.3 S2: comfortable

0:01:46.8 S2: and

0:01:47.1 S2: happy

0:01:47.9 S2: so

0:01:48.1 S2: Billy

0:01:48.4 S2: put

0:01:48.6 S2: on

0:01:48.8 S2: his

0:01:48.9 S2: backpack

0:01:49.9 S2: and

0:01:50.1 S2: walked

0:01:50.4 S2: back

0:01:50.7 S2: around

0:01:50.9 S2: to

0:01:51.1 S2: the

0:01:51.2 S2: front

0:01:51.4 S2: of

0:01:51.5 S2: the

0:01:51.7 S2: school.

0:01:53.2 S2: He

0:01:53.4 S2: walked

0:01:53.7 S2: right

0:01:53.9 S2: in

0:01:54.0 S2: the

0:01:54.1 S2: front

0:01:54.4 S2: door

0:01:54.7 S2: past

0:01:55.0 S2: the

0:01:55.1 S2: principal,

0:01:55.9 S2: and

0:01:56.5 S2: nobody

0:01:56.9 S2: noticed

0:01:57.2 S2: that

0:01:57.4 S2: he

0:01:57.5 S2: was

0:01:57.6 S2: carrying

0:01:58.0 S2: a

0:01:58.5 S2: dog.

0:02:00.2 S1: Billy's

0:02:01.5 S1: first

0:02:01.8 S1: class

0:02:02.1 S1: that

0:02:02.4 S1: day

0:02:02.7 S1: was

0:02:03.0 S1: math

0:02:04.3 S1: and

0:02:04.8 S1: so

0:02:05.0 S1: far

0:02:05.4 S1: so

0:02:05.6 S1: good,

0:02:05.9 S1: the

0:02:06.1 S1: dog

0:02:06.3 S1: was

0:02:06.5 S1: very

0:02:06.8 S1: quiet

0:02:07.5 S1: because

0:02:07.8 S1: the

0:02:07.9 S1: dog

0:02:08.2 S1: had

0:02:08.4 S1: found

0:02:08.6 S1: a

0:02:08.7 S1: little

0:02:09.0 S1: granola

0:02:09.6 S1: bar

0:02:09.9 S1: stuck

0:02:10.2 S1: in

0:02:10.4 S1: the

0:02:10.5 S1: bottom

0:02:10.8 S1: of

0:02:10.9 S1: the

0:02:11.1 S1: backpack.

0:02:12.4 S1: And

0:02:12.6 S1: so

0:02:12.7 S1: the

0:02:12.8 S1: dog

0:02:13.1 S1: was

0:02:13.3 S1: munching

0:02:13.8 S1: happily

0:02:14.3 S1: while

0:02:14.6 S1: Billy

0:02:14.9 S1: was

0:02:15.1 S1: doing

0:02:15.4 S1: his

0:02:15.6 S1: algebra

0:02:16.4 S1: and

0:02:16.6 S1: nobody

0:02:17.0 S1: was

0:02:17.3 S1: the

0:02:18.1 S1: wiser.

0:02:19.4 S1: But

0:02:19.6 S1: then

0:02:20.0 S1: math

0:02:20.3 S1: class

0:02:20.7 S1: ended,

0:02:21.3 S1: and

0:02:21.5 S1: Billy

0:02:21.8 S1: had

0:02:21.9 S1: to

0:02:22.1 S1: go

0:02:22.2 S1: to

0:02:22.4 S1: Spanish.

0:02:23.9 S1: As

0:02:24.1 S1: he

0:02:24.2 S1: walked

0:02:24.5 S1: down

0:02:24.7 S1: the

0:02:24.9 S1: hall,

0:02:25.6 S1: the

0:02:25.8 S1: dog

0:02:26.1 S1: could

0:02:26.2 S1: be

0:02:26.4 S1: heard

0:02:26.8 S1: grumbling

0:02:27.3 S1: a

0:02:27.4 S1: little

0:02:27.7 S1: bit.

0:02:28.0 S1: Billy

0:02:29.1 S1: started

0:02:29.4 S1: to

0:02:29.6 S1: cough.

0:02:32.4 S2: But

0:02:32.6 S2: nobody

0:02:33.0 S2: was

0:02:33.3 S2: fooled,

0:02:34.8 S2: everyone

0:02:35.4 S2: knew

0:02:35.6 S2: that

0:02:35.8 S2: there

0:02:36.0 S2: was

0:02:36.1 S2: a

0:02:36.3 S2: dog

0:02:36.9 S2: in

0:02:37.3 S2: Billy's

0:02:38.6 S2: backpack.

0:02:40.0 S2: Billy's

0:02:41.0 S2: friend

0:02:41.4 S2: Anne

0:02:42.0 S2: came

0:02:42.3 S2: over

0:02:42.6 S2: to

0:02:42.7 S2: him

0:02:42.9 S2: and

0:02:43.1 S2: said,

0:02:43.3 S2: "Billy,

0:02:44.6 S2: what

0:02:44.8 S2: was

0:02:45.0 S2: that?"

0:02:46.1 S2: And

0:02:46.3 S2: Billy

0:02:46.6 S2: said,

0:02:48.1 S2: "I've

0:02:48.3 S2: got

0:02:49.2 S2: this

0:02:49.5 S2: dog.

0:02:49.9 S2: This

0:02:50.3 S2: dog

0:02:50.5 S2: followed

0:02:50.8 S2: me

0:02:50.9 S2: to

0:02:51.1 S2: school."

0:02:52.4 S2: Anne

0:02:52.8 S2: opened

0:02:53.1 S2: up

0:02:53.6 S2: Billy's

0:02:54.0 S2: bag

0:02:54.3 S2: and

0:02:54.4 S2: looked

0:02:54.6 S2: inside,

0:02:56.1 S2: and

0:02:56.9 S2: the

0:02:57.0 S2: dog

0:02:58.8 S2: jumped

0:02:59.1 S2: out

0:02:59.3 S2: and

0:02:59.6 S2: licked

0:02:59.8 S2: her

0:02:59.9 S2: in

0:03:00.0 S2: the

0:03:00.2 S2: face.

0:03:03.2 S1: Anne

0:03:03.5 S1: was

0:03:03.6 S1: taken

0:03:04.0 S1: with

0:03:04.1 S1: the

0:03:04.3 S1: dog

0:03:04.7 S1: too,

0:03:05.1 S1: and

0:03:05.2 S1: so

0:03:05.4 S1: they

0:03:06.3 S1: decided

0:03:06.8 S1: to

0:03:06.9 S1: hatch

0:03:07.1 S1: a

0:03:07.4 S1: plan

0:03:08.3 S1: to

0:03:08.5 S1: store

0:03:08.8 S1: the

0:03:09.0 S1: dog

0:03:09.5 S1: in

0:03:09.6 S1: the

0:03:09.8 S1: principal's

0:03:10.5 S1: office

0:03:10.9 S1: while

0:03:11.2 S1: the

0:03:11.3 S1: principal

0:03:11.8 S1: was

0:03:12.0 S1: on

0:03:12.2 S1: break.

0:03:13.0 S1: And

0:03:13.2 S1: then

0:03:13.4 S1: they

0:03:13.5 S1: would

0:03:13.7 S1: come

0:03:14.1 S1: rescue

0:03:14.5 S1: the

0:03:14.7 S1: dog

0:03:15.2 S1: after

0:03:15.8 S1: their

0:03:16.3 S1: PE

0:03:16.7 S1: practice.

0:03:18.3 S1: So

0:03:18.4 S1: they

0:03:18.7 S1: snuck

0:03:19.0 S1: into

0:03:19.3 S1: the

0:03:19.4 S1: principal's

0:03:19.9 S1: office,

0:03:20.8 S1: and

0:03:21.0 S1: in

0:03:21.2 S1: the

0:03:21.4 S1: principal's

0:03:22.0 S1: closet,

0:03:22.8 S1: they

0:03:23.0 S1: put

0:03:23.3 S1: Billy

0:03:24.4 S1: and

0:03:24.7 S1: left

0:03:25.1 S1: a

0:03:25.2 S1: note

0:03:25.4 S1: for

0:03:25.5 S1: the

0:03:25.6 S1: principal

0:03:26.0 S1: in

0:03:26.1 S1: case

0:03:26.4 S1: he

0:03:26.6 S1: came

0:03:26.9 S1: back.

0:03:27.3 S1: The

0:03:28.4 S1: note

0:03:29.7 S1: said...

0:03:31.0 S2: "Check

0:03:32.6 S2: out

0:03:33.4 S2: this

0:03:33.8 S2: cool

0:03:34.3 S2: dog."

0:03:38.6 S2: They

0:03:38.9 S2: didn't

0:03:39.6 S2: really

0:03:40.0 S2: think

0:03:40.1 S2: it

0:03:40.3 S2: all

0:03:40.4 S2: the

0:03:40.6 S2: way

0:03:40.8 S2: through,

0:03:41.7 S2: because

0:03:42.0 S2: the

0:03:42.2 S2: principal

0:03:42.6 S2: would

0:03:42.8 S2: definitely

0:03:43.4 S2: be

0:03:43.6 S2: angry

0:03:45.7 S2: if

0:03:45.9 S2: they

0:03:46.1 S2: found

0:03:46.3 S2: the

0:03:46.5 S2: dog.

0:03:48.8 S2: But

0:03:49.1 S2: they

0:03:49.3 S2: drew

0:03:49.6 S2: some

0:03:49.8 S2: pictures

0:03:50.2 S2: on

0:03:50.4 S2: the

0:03:50.5 S2: note.

0:03:53.3 S2: They

0:03:53.5 S2: drew

0:03:53.7 S2: a

0:03:53.8 S2: little

0:03:54.1 S2: picture

0:03:54.4 S2: of

0:03:54.6 S2: the

0:03:54.7 S2: dog

0:03:55.7 S2: and

0:03:55.9 S2: hoped

0:03:56.2 S2: that

0:03:56.4 S2: that

0:03:56.7 S2: would

0:03:57.3 S2: cheer

0:03:57.5 S2: the

0:03:57.7 S2: principal

0:03:58.1 S2: up,

0:03:58.7 S2: then

0:03:58.9 S2: they

0:03:59.1 S2: ran

0:03:59.3 S2: out

0:03:59.5 S2: to

0:03:59.7 S2: PE

0:04:01.0 S2: class.

0:04:03.3 S1: After

0:04:03.6 S1: PE

0:04:03.8 S1: class

0:04:04.1 S1: they

0:04:04.4 S1: came

0:04:04.6 S1: back

0:04:04.8 S1: and

0:04:04.9 S1: the

0:04:05.1 S1: dog

0:04:05.3 S1: was

0:04:05.6 S1: still

0:04:05.8 S1: there.

0:04:07.3 S1: So

0:04:07.4 S1: they

0:04:07.6 S1: took

0:04:07.8 S1: the

0:04:08.0 S1: dog

0:04:08.9 S1: out

0:04:09.0 S1: of

0:04:09.1 S1: the

0:04:09.3 S1: closet,

0:04:09.8 S1: realizing

0:04:10.4 S1: that

0:04:10.5 S1: that

0:04:10.7 S1: was

0:04:10.9 S1: probably

0:04:11.4 S1: a

0:04:11.5 S1: pretty

0:04:11.9 S1: dumb

0:04:12.1 S1: idea

0:04:12.6 S1: in

0:04:12.8 S1: retrospect.

0:04:14.4 S1: So

0:04:14.6 S1: they

0:04:14.7 S1: took

0:04:14.9 S1: the

0:04:15.1 S1: dog

0:04:15.6 S1: and

0:04:15.8 S1: they

0:04:16.0 S1: tried

0:04:16.2 S1: to

0:04:16.8 S1: figure

0:04:17.1 S1: out

0:04:17.2 S1: a

0:04:17.4 S1: way

0:04:17.9 S1: to

0:04:18.1 S1: keep

0:04:18.3 S1: the

0:04:18.4 S1: dog

0:04:18.7 S1: quiet

0:04:19.1 S1: until

0:04:19.4 S1: the

0:04:19.6 S1: end

0:04:19.8 S1: of

0:04:20.0 S1: school.

0:04:21.0 S1: So

0:04:21.2 S1: they

0:04:21.3 S1: went

0:04:21.5 S1: behind

0:04:22.3 S1: the

0:04:22.6 S1: school

0:04:23.1 S1: and

0:04:23.3 S1: they

0:04:23.5 S1: found

0:04:23.9 S1: a

0:04:24.0 S1: little

0:04:24.4 S1: shed

0:04:25.0 S1: where

0:04:25.2 S1: there

0:04:25.4 S1: were

0:04:26.0 S1: rooms

0:04:26.5 S1: and

0:04:26.8 S1: other

0:04:27.2 S1: lawn

0:04:27.9 S1: equipment

0:04:29.1 S1: and

0:04:29.4 S1: stuffed

0:04:30.5 S1: the

0:04:31.1 S1: dog...

0:04:31.5 S2: Inside

0:04:32.0 S2: the

0:04:33.3 S2: shed.

0:04:34.9 S2: They

0:04:36.2 S2: went

0:04:36.4 S2: back

0:04:37.3 S2: to

0:04:38.3 S2: their

0:04:38.6 S2: final

0:04:39.0 S2: class

0:04:39.4 S2: before

0:04:39.8 S2: lunch,

0:04:41.3 S2: and

0:04:41.9 S2: for

0:04:42.1 S2: the

0:04:42.2 S2: whole

0:04:42.5 S2: time

0:04:42.8 S2: in

0:04:43.0 S2: class,

0:04:43.5 S2: neither

0:04:43.7 S2: of

0:04:43.8 S2: them

0:04:44.1 S2: could

0:04:44.3 S2: stop

0:04:44.5 S2: thinking

0:04:44.9 S2: about

0:04:45.3 S2: the

0:04:45.6 S2: cute

0:04:45.8 S2: little

0:04:46.0 S2: dog.

0:04:47.7 S2: When

0:04:48.0 S2: lunch

0:04:48.6 S2: period

0:04:49.2 S2: begun,

0:04:49.7 S2: they

0:04:49.9 S2: came

0:04:50.1 S2: outside

0:04:51.1 S2: and

0:04:51.3 S2: they

0:04:51.5 S2: were

0:04:51.7 S2: so

0:04:51.9 S2: excited

0:04:52.5 S2: to

0:04:52.7 S2: play

0:04:52.9 S2: with

0:04:53.0 S2: the

0:04:53.1 S2: dog

0:04:53.4 S2: that

0:04:53.6 S2: they

0:04:53.8 S2: told

0:04:54.6 S2: a

0:04:54.7 S2: bunch

0:04:54.9 S2: of

0:04:55.0 S2: their

0:04:55.3 S2: friends

0:04:55.7 S2: to

0:04:55.9 S2: come

0:04:56.1 S2: over

0:04:56.3 S2: and

0:04:56.6 S2: check

0:04:56.8 S2: it

0:04:56.9 S2: out.

0:04:58.1 S2: They

0:04:58.3 S2: went

0:04:58.5 S2: back

0:04:58.6 S2: to

0:04:58.8 S2: the

0:04:58.9 S2: shed,

0:05:01.6 S2: and...

0:05:01.9 S1: And

0:05:01.9 S1: there

0:05:02.3 S1: was

0:05:02.5 S1: the

0:05:02.7 S1: groundskeeper

0:05:03.7 S1: looking

0:05:04.1 S1: very

0:05:04.6 S1: angry.

0:05:05.5 S1: Apparently,

0:05:06.6 S1: in

0:05:06.8 S1: their

0:05:07.0 S1: absence,

0:05:07.9 S1: the

0:05:08.0 S1: dog

0:05:08.3 S1: had

0:05:08.6 S1: chewed

0:05:08.9 S1: through

0:05:09.3 S1: the

0:05:09.5 S1: back

0:05:09.7 S1: of

0:05:09.8 S1: the

0:05:10.0 S1: shed

0:05:10.9 S1: and

0:05:11.0 S1: left

0:05:11.2 S1: a

0:05:11.4 S1: big

0:05:11.7 S1: gaping

0:05:12.6 S1: hole.

0:05:13.5 S1: And

0:05:13.5 S1: the

0:05:13.5 S1: groundskeeper

0:05:13.5 S1: took

0:05:13.5 S1: the

0:05:13.6 S1: dog

0:05:13.6 S1: by

0:05:13.6 S1: the

0:05:13.7 S1: scruff

0:05:16.7 S1: of

0:05:16.9 S1: the

0:05:17.0 S1: neck

0:05:18.1 S1: and

0:05:18.3 S1: marched

0:05:18.7 S1: the

0:05:18.8 S1: dog

0:05:19.3 S1: back

0:05:19.6 S1: into

0:05:19.9 S1: the

0:05:20.1 S1: school

0:05:20.7 S1: and

0:05:20.9 S1: found

0:05:21.3 S1: the

0:05:21.4 S1: principal.

0:05:22.4 S1: The

0:05:22.6 S1: principal

0:05:23.0 S1: looked

0:05:23.6 S1: very

0:05:24.0 S1: upset

0:05:24.8 S1: and

0:05:25.0 S1: called

0:05:25.4 S1: Billy

0:05:25.9 S1: and

0:05:26.2 S1: Anne's

0:05:26.6 S1: parents.

0:05:28.4 S1: When

0:05:28.6 S1: the

0:05:28.8 S1: phone

0:05:29.1 S1: rang...

0:05:30.8 S2: Billy's

0:05:33.1 S2: dad

0:05:33.5 S2: answered.

0:05:34.1 S2: Billy's

0:05:36.7 S2: dad

0:05:37.6 S2: couldn't

0:05:38.0 S2: quite

0:05:38.3 S2: understand

0:05:39.0 S2: why

0:05:39.1 S2: the

0:05:39.3 S2: principal

0:05:39.8 S2: was

0:05:39.9 S2: so

0:05:40.2 S2: angry

0:05:41.0 S2: and

0:05:41.2 S2: was

0:05:41.5 S2: mostly

0:05:41.9 S2: concerned

0:05:42.4 S2: about

0:05:42.7 S2: the

0:05:42.8 S2: well-

0:05:43.0 S2: being

0:05:43.3 S2: of

0:05:43.4 S2: the

0:05:43.5 S2: dog.

0:05:44.6 S2: He

0:05:44.7 S2: wanted

0:05:45.0 S2: to

0:05:45.2 S2: know

0:05:45.5 S2: if

0:05:46.0 S2: they

0:05:46.2 S2: knew

0:05:46.5 S2: who

0:05:46.7 S2: dog's

0:05:47.0 S2: owner

0:05:47.3 S2: was

0:05:47.8 S2: and

0:05:47.9 S2: if

0:05:48.0 S2: they

0:05:48.2 S2: could

0:05:48.4 S2: find

0:05:48.6 S2: a

0:05:48.7 S2: way

0:05:49.9 S2: to

0:05:50.1 S2: get

0:05:50.3 S2: the

0:05:50.4 S2: dog

0:05:51.5 S2: back

0:05:51.8 S2: to

0:05:52.0 S2: its

0:05:52.1 S2: home.

0:05:54.2 S2: The

0:05:54.3 S2: principal

0:05:55.7 S2: became

0:05:56.3 S2: extremely

0:05:56.9 S2: angry

0:05:57.5 S2: at

0:05:57.7 S2: Billy's

0:05:58.1 S2: father...

0:06:01.1 S1: And

0:06:01.2 S1: he

0:06:01.5 S1: slammed

0:06:01.9 S1: down

0:06:02.2 S1: the

0:06:02.3 S1: phone

0:06:02.9 S1: and

0:06:03.0 S1: then

0:06:03.3 S1: called

0:06:03.6 S1: Anne's

0:06:05.0 S1: mother.

0:06:06.2 S1: When

0:06:06.4 S1: Anne's

0:06:06.9 S1: mother

0:06:07.5 S1: answered,

0:06:08.3 S1: she

0:06:08.5 S1: had

0:06:08.7 S1: the

0:06:08.9 S1: same

0:06:09.2 S1: response

0:06:09.8 S1: as

0:06:10.1 S1: Billy's

0:06:10.9 S1: dad.

0:06:11.2 S1: This

0:06:11.6 S1: made

0:06:11.8 S1: the

0:06:11.9 S1: principal

0:06:12.3 S1: extremely

0:06:13.2 S1: angry

0:06:13.9 S1: because

0:06:14.1 S1: he

0:06:14.3 S1: realized

0:06:14.8 S1: that

0:06:15.0 S1: the

0:06:15.2 S1: parents

0:06:16.0 S1: did

0:06:16.1 S1: not

0:06:16.5 S1: respect

0:06:17.2 S1: school

0:06:17.7 S1: discipline.

0:06:18.6 S1: So

0:06:18.9 S1: he

0:06:19.1 S1: slammed

0:06:19.8 S1: down

0:06:20.1 S1: the

0:06:20.3 S1: phone

0:06:20.7 S1: on

0:06:21.1 S1: Anne's

0:06:21.6 S1: mother

0:06:22.2 S1: as

0:06:22.4 S1: well

0:06:22.8 S1: prompting

0:06:23.4 S1: Billy's

0:06:23.9 S1: dad

0:06:24.4 S1: and

0:06:24.6 S1: Anne's

0:06:24.9 S1: mother

0:06:25.2 S1: to

0:06:25.3 S1: call

0:06:25.5 S1: each

0:06:25.8 S1: other

0:06:26.2 S1: to

0:06:26.4 S1: compare

0:06:26.9 S1: notes.

0:06:28.2 S1: Then

0:06:32.6 S1: when

0:06:32.8 S1: they...

0:06:30.6 S2: When

0:06:33.0 S2: they

0:06:33.0 S2: found

0:06:33.4 S2: that

0:06:35.4 S2: the...

0:06:36.6 S2: When

0:06:36.7 S2: they

0:06:36.9 S2: talked

0:06:37.1 S2: to

0:06:37.2 S2: each

0:06:37.4 S2: other,

0:06:37.7 S2: they

0:06:37.9 S2: realized

0:06:39.0 S2: that

0:06:40.3 S2: the

0:06:40.4 S2: principal's

0:06:41.1 S2: problem

0:06:42.5 S2: was

0:06:42.9 S2: not

0:06:43.3 S2: so

0:06:43.5 S2: much

0:06:44.1 S2: with

0:06:46.0 S2: the

0:06:46.2 S2: dog

0:06:46.7 S2: or

0:06:46.9 S2: Billy

0:06:47.4 S2: and

0:06:47.8 S2: Anne's

0:06:47.8 S2: behavior,

0:06:49.7 S2: but

0:06:50.8 S2: was

0:06:51.1 S2: maybe

0:06:51.4 S2: about

0:06:51.8 S2: their

0:06:52.1 S2: own

0:06:52.5 S2: complicated

0:06:53.3 S2: feelings

0:06:55.3 S2: about...

0:06:56.1 S2: I

0:06:56.2 S2: don't

0:06:56.4 S2: know,

0:06:57.3 S2: childhood

0:06:58.5 S2: and

0:06:59.2 S2: enjoyment

0:07:00.1 S2: of

0:07:00.3 S2: life.

0:07:00.7 S1: So

0:07:02.0 S1: Billy

0:07:04.1 S1: and

0:07:04.5 S1: Anne

0:07:04.5 S1: decided

0:07:05.3 S1: that

0:07:05.5 S1: they

0:07:05.6 S1: were

0:07:05.8 S1: gonna

0:07:06.1 S1: drive

0:07:06.4 S1: to

0:07:06.6 S1: the

0:07:06.9 S1: school

0:07:07.5 S1: and

0:07:07.8 S1: talk

0:07:08.1 S1: to

0:07:08.2 S1: the

0:07:08.4 S1: principal

0:07:09.8 S1: and

0:07:10.0 S1: maybe

0:07:10.2 S1: have

0:07:10.5 S1: a

0:07:10.6 S1: heart-

0:07:10.8 S1: to-

0:07:11.0 S1: heart

0:07:11.8 S1: about

0:07:12.1 S1: what

0:07:12.3 S1: it

0:07:12.5 S1: means

0:07:12.9 S1: to

0:07:13.0 S1: be

0:07:13.1 S1: a

0:07:13.3 S1: child,

0:07:14.3 S1: and

0:07:14.4 S1: what

0:07:14.6 S1: is

0:07:14.8 S1: the

0:07:15.0 S1: purpose

0:07:15.7 S1: of

0:07:15.9 S1: education

0:07:16.7 S1: in

0:07:16.9 S1: the

0:07:17.0 S1: grand

0:07:17.4 S1: scheme

0:07:17.9 S1: of

0:07:18.1 S1: life.

0:07:18.9 S1: Including

0:07:19.5 S1: how

0:07:19.7 S1: to

0:07:19.8 S1: be

0:07:19.9 S1: a

0:07:20.2 S1: good

0:07:20.3 S1: citizen

0:07:21.2 S1: and

0:07:21.4 S1: how

0:07:21.5 S1: to

0:07:22.1 S1: commit

0:07:22.4 S1: your

0:07:22.6 S1: life

0:07:23.6 S1: to

0:07:24.2 S1: service.

0:07:24.8 S1: So

0:07:25.0 S1: Billy's

0:07:25.5 S1: dad

0:07:25.8 S1: picked

0:07:26.3 S1: up

0:07:26.5 S1: Anne's

0:07:27.0 S1: mom,

0:07:27.2 S1: and

0:07:27.4 S1: together

0:07:27.8 S1: they

0:07:28.0 S1: went

0:07:28.3 S1: to

0:07:28.5 S1: the

0:07:28.7 S1: school.

0:07:33.0 S2: They

0:07:33.1 S2: arrived

0:07:33.7 S2: and

0:07:33.9 S2: went

0:07:34.1 S2: directly

0:07:34.5 S2: to

0:07:34.6 S2: the

0:07:34.7 S2: principal's

0:07:35.2 S2: office,

0:07:35.7 S2: where

0:07:36.3 S2: Billy

0:07:36.9 S2: and

0:07:37.3 S2: Anne

0:07:37.7 S2: and

0:07:38.0 S2: the

0:07:38.2 S2: principal

0:07:38.7 S2: were

0:07:38.9 S2: waiting

0:07:40.7 S2: but

0:07:42.2 S2: the

0:07:42.4 S2: principal

0:07:45.3 S2: remained

0:07:46.3 S2: angry.

0:07:47.4 S2: But

0:07:48.1 S2: Billy

0:07:48.6 S2: and

0:07:49.0 S2: Anne

0:07:49.3 S2: were

0:07:49.6 S2: becoming

0:07:50.1 S2: increasingly

0:07:50.9 S2: upset

0:07:51.5 S2: about

0:07:52.0 S2: the

0:07:52.2 S2: state

0:07:52.4 S2: of

0:07:52.6 S2: the

0:07:52.8 S2: dog.

0:07:54.4 S2: The

0:07:54.6 S2: dog

0:07:54.8 S2: had

0:07:55.0 S2: run

0:07:55.2 S2: off

0:07:55.9 S2: and

0:07:56.3 S2: nobody

0:07:56.6 S2: knew

0:07:56.8 S2: where

0:07:56.9 S2: it

0:07:57.0 S2: was,

0:07:57.7 S2: and

0:07:57.9 S2: they

0:07:58.0 S2: were

0:07:58.2 S2: upset

0:07:58.6 S2: that

0:07:58.7 S2: the

0:07:58.8 S2: principal

0:07:59.3 S2: didn't

0:07:59.5 S2: seem

0:07:59.7 S2: to

0:07:59.9 S2: care.

0:08:00.3 S1: So

0:08:00.8 S1: Billy

0:08:01.7 S1: and

0:08:02.4 S1: Anne

0:08:03.1 S1: left

0:08:03.8 S1: their

0:08:04.1 S1: parents

0:08:04.8 S1: and

0:08:04.9 S1: the

0:08:05.1 S1: principal

0:08:05.9 S1: having

0:08:06.2 S1: a

0:08:06.4 S1: heart-

0:08:06.6 S1: to-

0:08:06.6 S1: heart

0:08:07.2 S1: session

0:08:07.6 S1: about

0:08:07.9 S1: something,

0:08:08.5 S1: about

0:08:08.8 S1: life

0:08:09.1 S1: and

0:08:09.3 S1: childhood

0:08:09.8 S1: that

0:08:09.9 S1: they

0:08:10.1 S1: didn't

0:08:10.4 S1: understand,

0:08:11.6 S1: and

0:08:11.8 S1: they

0:08:12.0 S1: went

0:08:12.3 S1: in

0:08:12.5 S1: search

0:08:12.7 S1: of

0:08:12.9 S1: the

0:08:13.0 S1: dog.

0:08:13.9 S1: They

0:08:14.1 S1: figured

0:08:16.1 S1: school

0:08:16.4 S1: was

0:08:16.6 S1: not

0:08:16.9 S1: as

0:08:17.1 S1: important

0:08:17.8 S1: as

0:08:18.0 S1: figuring

0:08:18.4 S1: out

0:08:18.7 S1: what

0:08:18.9 S1: had

0:08:19.1 S1: happened

0:08:19.4 S1: to

0:08:19.5 S1: the

0:08:19.7 S1: dog

0:08:20.1 S1: and

0:08:20.2 S1: whether

0:08:20.5 S1: it

0:08:20.7 S1: was

0:08:20.8 S1: okay.

0:08:22.2 S1: So

0:08:22.3 S1: they

0:08:22.5 S1: walked

0:08:22.8 S1: straight

0:08:23.1 S1: out

0:08:23.3 S1: the

0:08:23.4 S1: front

0:08:23.8 S1: door

0:08:24.0 S1: of

0:08:24.0 S1: the

0:08:24.3 S1: school

0:08:25.0 S1: and

0:08:25.4 S1: split

0:08:25.7 S1: up

0:08:26.0 S1: while

0:08:26.1 S1: they

0:08:26.3 S1: searched

0:08:26.7 S1: for

0:08:26.8 S1: the

0:08:27.0 S1: dog

0:08:27.4 S1: and

0:08:27.6 S1: tried

0:08:27.8 S1: to

0:08:28.0 S1: find

0:08:28.2 S1: him.

0:08:31.1 S2: They

0:08:31.3 S2: walked

0:08:31.6 S2: down

0:08:31.9 S2: Main

0:08:32.6 S2: Street

0:08:33.3 S2: asking

0:08:33.9 S2: each

0:08:34.1 S2: of

0:08:34.3 S2: the

0:08:34.6 S2: shopkeepers

0:08:36.0 S2: if

0:08:36.2 S2: they

0:08:36.4 S2: had

0:08:36.7 S2: seen

0:08:37.6 S2: a

0:08:37.8 S2: small

0:08:38.3 S2: dog,

0:08:39.3 S2: and

0:08:39.5 S2: they

0:08:39.6 S2: described

0:08:40.1 S2: the

0:08:40.2 S2: dog.

0:08:42.5 S2: Nobody

0:08:42.9 S2: had

0:08:43.1 S2: seen

0:08:43.3 S2: the

0:08:43.4 S2: dog

0:08:44.3 S2: until

0:08:44.9 S2: they

0:08:45.1 S2: got

0:08:45.4 S2: to

0:08:45.6 S2: the

0:08:45.7 S2: hardware

0:08:46.2 S2: store.

0:08:47.2 S2: When

0:08:47.3 S2: they

0:08:47.4 S2: go

0:08:47.6 S2: to

0:08:47.7 S2: the

0:08:47.8 S2: hardware

0:08:48.2 S2: store,

0:08:48.6 S2: they

0:08:48.8 S2: asked

0:08:49.1 S2: the

0:08:49.2 S2: owner,

0:08:50.1 S2: and

0:08:50.2 S2: the

0:08:50.4 S2: owner

0:08:50.7 S2: said,

0:08:51.5 S2: "Oh,

0:08:51.9 S2: I

0:08:52.1 S2: haven't

0:08:52.4 S2: seen

0:08:52.7 S2: that

0:08:52.8 S2: dog

0:08:53.1 S2: today,

0:08:53.9 S2: but

0:08:54.0 S2: it

0:08:54.2 S2: sounds

0:08:54.5 S2: like

0:08:54.7 S2: you're

0:08:54.9 S2: describing

0:08:55.7 S2: old

0:08:56.0 S2: man

0:08:56.4 S2: Caruthers'

0:08:57.2 S2: dog."

0:08:57.7 S1: Old

0:08:58.6 S1: man

0:08:59.5 S1: Caruthers

0:09:01.6 S1: was

0:09:02.0 S1: a

0:09:02.2 S1: very

0:09:02.7 S1: spooky

0:09:03.2 S1: character

0:09:03.8 S1: in

0:09:03.9 S1: the

0:09:04.1 S1: town.

0:09:04.5 S1: In

0:09:04.9 S1: fact,

0:09:05.5 S1: the

0:09:05.6 S1: kids

0:09:06.0 S1: weren't

0:09:06.3 S1: sure

0:09:06.7 S1: that

0:09:06.9 S1: anybody

0:09:07.4 S1: had

0:09:07.5 S1: ever

0:09:07.8 S1: really

0:09:08.2 S1: seen

0:09:08.5 S1: him.

0:09:09.6 S1: He

0:09:09.8 S1: lived

0:09:10.1 S1: in

0:09:10.2 S1: this

0:09:10.6 S1: very

0:09:11.4 S1: creepy,

0:09:12.1 S1: dark

0:09:12.7 S1: house

0:09:13.7 S1: where

0:09:14.0 S1: the

0:09:14.1 S1: windows

0:09:14.6 S1: were

0:09:14.8 S1: all

0:09:15.0 S1: broken

0:09:15.4 S1: out

0:09:15.9 S1: on

0:09:16.0 S1: the

0:09:16.2 S1: edge

0:09:16.4 S1: of

0:09:16.6 S1: town.

0:09:17.8 S1: Some

0:09:18.1 S1: kids

0:09:18.3 S1: had

0:09:18.5 S1: dared

0:09:18.7 S1: them

0:09:19.0 S1: before

0:09:19.4 S1: to

0:09:19.6 S1: go

0:09:19.7 S1: inside,

0:09:20.6 S1: but

0:09:20.7 S1: they

0:09:20.9 S1: were

0:09:21.1 S1: too

0:09:21.4 S1: scared

0:09:21.9 S1: to

0:09:22.0 S1: do

0:09:22.3 S1: so.

0:09:23.7 S1: So

0:09:24.4 S1: they

0:09:24.6 S1: decided

0:09:25.4 S1: that

0:09:25.7 S1: together,

0:09:26.6 S1: they

0:09:26.7 S1: were

0:09:26.9 S1: brave

0:09:27.2 S1: enough

0:09:27.8 S1: that

0:09:28.0 S1: they

0:09:28.2 S1: would

0:09:28.4 S1: go

0:09:28.7 S1: find

0:09:29.1 S1: old

0:09:29.5 S1: man

0:09:29.7 S1: Caruthers'

0:09:30.2 S1: house.

0:09:33.3 S2: Matt

0:09:33.5 S2: and

0:09:33.8 S2: Terry,

0:09:34.2 S2: if

0:09:34.4 S2: you're

0:09:34.6 S2: listening

0:09:35.1 S2: to

0:09:35.6 S2: just

0:09:35.8 S2: put...

0:09:36.0 S2: Okay,

0:09:36.5 S2: it's

0:09:36.9 S2: back.

0:09:37.2 S2: Fantastic.

0:09:39.5 S2: So

0:09:40.8 S2: they

0:09:41.8 S2: walked

0:09:42.1 S2: out

0:09:42.3 S2: past

0:09:42.3 S2: the

0:09:42.3 S2: center

0:09:42.3 S2: of

0:09:42.3 S2: town,

0:09:42.3 S2: out

0:09:42.3 S2: to

0:09:46.5 S2: the

0:09:46.6 S2: edges,

0:09:48.1 S2: down

0:09:48.8 S2: the

0:09:50.1 S2: side

0:09:50.5 S2: streets

0:09:51.1 S2: and

0:09:51.4 S2: cul-

0:09:51.7 S2: de-

0:09:51.9 S2: sacs

0:09:52.2 S2: trying

0:09:52.7 S2: to

0:09:52.8 S2: find

0:09:53.1 S2: old

0:09:53.5 S2: man

0:09:53.7 S2: Caruthers'

0:09:54.1 S2: house.

0:09:55.9 S2: When

0:09:56.1 S2: they

0:09:56.3 S2: finally

0:09:56.7 S2: found

0:09:57.0 S2: it,

0:09:58.5 S2: the

0:09:58.7 S2: sun

0:09:58.9 S2: was

0:09:59.1 S2: beginning

0:09:59.5 S2: to

0:09:59.7 S2: set.

0:10:01.2 S1: And

0:10:02.2 S1: they

0:10:02.4 S1: looked

0:10:02.6 S1: at

0:10:02.7 S1: each

0:10:02.9 S1: other

0:10:03.5 S1: and

0:10:03.7 S1: they

0:10:04.5 S1: decided

0:10:05.1 S1: that

0:10:05.2 S1: they

0:10:05.3 S1: were

0:10:05.5 S1: gonna

0:10:05.8 S1: go

0:10:06.0 S1: through

0:10:06.3 S1: with

0:10:06.5 S1: it.

0:10:07.9 S1: But

0:10:08.1 S1: it

0:10:08.2 S1: was

0:10:08.5 S1: dark

0:10:09.2 S1: and

0:10:09.3 S1: they

0:10:09.5 S1: were

0:10:09.8 S1: scared.

0:10:11.6 S1: So

0:10:11.8 S1: they

0:10:11.9 S1: opened

0:10:12.3 S1: up

0:10:12.5 S1: the

0:10:12.9 S1: creaky

0:10:13.4 S1: gate

0:10:13.7 S1: with

0:10:13.9 S1: a

0:10:14.4 S1: really

0:10:15.5 S1: weird

0:10:16.0 S1: sound,

0:10:17.1 S1: and

0:10:17.3 S1: they

0:10:17.7 S1: walked

0:10:18.6 S1: towards

0:10:19.0 S1: the

0:10:19.2 S1: front

0:10:19.5 S1: door.

0:10:20.6 S1: Suddenly,

0:10:21.2 S1: a

0:10:21.3 S1: black

0:10:21.7 S1: cat

0:10:21.9 S1: shot

0:10:22.2 S1: across

0:10:22.7 S1: their

0:10:23.0 S1: path.

0:10:23.5 S1: They

0:10:23.7 S1: looked

0:10:23.9 S1: at

0:10:24.0 S1: each

0:10:24.2 S1: other

0:10:24.5 S1: and

0:10:24.8 S1: shuddered.

0:10:25.9 S1: And

0:10:26.0 S1: then

0:10:26.2 S1: they

0:10:26.3 S1: got

0:10:26.5 S1: to

0:10:26.7 S1: the

0:10:26.9 S1: front

0:10:27.2 S1: door

0:10:28.0 S1: and

0:10:28.1 S1: they

0:10:28.4 S1: knocked.

0:10:31.5 S2: After

0:10:32.0 S2: they

0:10:33.3 S2: knocked

0:10:35.2 S2: they

0:10:35.4 S2: heard

0:10:37.3 S2: creaking

0:10:37.9 S2: sounds

0:10:38.3 S2: coming

0:10:38.6 S2: from

0:10:38.8 S2: inside

0:10:39.3 S2: the

0:10:39.5 S2: house

0:10:40.3 S2: as

0:10:40.5 S2: somebody

0:10:41.0 S2: walked

0:10:41.6 S2: across

0:10:42.3 S2: an

0:10:42.6 S2: old

0:10:43.1 S2: wooden

0:10:43.6 S2: floor.

0:10:46.4 S2: The

0:10:46.6 S2: person

0:10:47.1 S2: got

0:10:47.4 S2: to

0:10:47.5 S2: the

0:10:47.6 S2: door

0:10:48.6 S2: and

0:10:49.3 S2: looked

0:10:49.6 S2: at

0:10:49.7 S2: them

0:10:50.0 S2: through

0:10:50.3 S2: the

0:10:50.4 S2: peephole

0:10:53.7 S2: and

0:10:53.9 S2: then

0:10:54.9 S2: they

0:10:55.1 S2: heard

0:10:55.3 S2: a

0:10:55.5 S2: voice

0:10:55.9 S2: from

0:10:56.1 S2: inside

0:10:56.8 S2: saying,

0:10:58.1 S2: "Who

0:10:58.3 S2: is

0:10:58.5 S2: it?

0:10:59.3 S2: Who's

0:10:59.6 S2: knocking

0:11:00.0 S2: on

0:11:00.2 S2: my

0:11:00.4 S2: door?"

0:11:02.9 S1: Billy

0:11:03.3 S1: and

0:11:03.6 S1: Anne

0:11:04.1 S1: grabbed

0:11:04.4 S1: each

0:11:04.5 S1: other's

0:11:04.8 S1: hand

0:11:05.3 S1: tightly

0:11:06.2 S1: and

0:11:06.9 S1: Billy

0:11:07.7 S1: said,

0:11:09.7 S1: "Mr.

0:11:10.0 S1: Caruthers,

0:11:11.4 S1: it

0:11:11.6 S1: is

0:11:11.8 S1: Billy

0:11:12.2 S1: Johnson

0:11:12.8 S1: here

0:11:13.4 S1: from

0:11:13.6 S1: down

0:11:14.0 S1: the

0:11:14.2 S1: street

0:11:15.3 S1: and

0:11:15.8 S1: we

0:11:16.0 S1: were

0:11:16.2 S1: wondering

0:11:17.6 S1: if

0:11:18.0 S1: you

0:11:18.3 S1: had

0:11:18.5 S1: a

0:11:18.7 S1: dog

0:11:19.4 S1: and

0:11:19.6 S1: whether

0:11:19.9 S1: you

0:11:20.2 S1: had

0:11:20.4 S1: seen

0:11:20.6 S1: it

0:11:20.7 S1: lately?

0:11:21.8 S1: Because

0:11:22.7 S1: we

0:11:23.0 S1: saw

0:11:23.3 S1: a

0:11:23.5 S1: dog

0:11:24.5 S1: and

0:11:24.7 S1: we

0:11:25.0 S1: had

0:11:25.1 S1: it

0:11:25.3 S1: for

0:11:25.5 S1: a

0:11:25.6 S1: while,

0:11:25.9 S1: but

0:11:26.1 S1: it's

0:11:26.3 S1: ran

0:11:26.6 S1: away,

0:11:27.6 S1: and

0:11:27.8 S1: the

0:11:28.0 S1: man

0:11:28.2 S1: at

0:11:28.4 S1: the

0:11:28.5 S1: hardware

0:11:29.1 S1: store

0:11:29.6 S1: said... "

0:11:31.4 S2: "That

0:11:31.5 S2: it

0:11:31.7 S2: looked

0:11:31.9 S2: like

0:11:32.1 S2: it

0:11:32.2 S2: was

0:11:32.4 S2: yours."

0:11:35.8 S2: Then

0:11:36.2 S2: suddenly,

0:11:38.1 S2: the

0:11:38.3 S2: old

0:11:38.5 S2: man

0:11:38.8 S2: opened

0:11:39.2 S2: the

0:11:39.3 S2: door.

0:11:41.7 S2: He

0:11:42.1 S2: was

0:11:43.2 S2: very

0:11:43.6 S2: tall,

0:11:44.2 S2: over

0:11:44.6 S2: six

0:11:44.9 S2: foot

0:11:45.7 S2: and

0:11:45.9 S2: extremely

0:11:46.8 S2: skinny

0:11:47.8 S2: and

0:11:48.1 S2: was

0:11:48.4 S2: wearing

0:11:49.6 S2: what

0:11:49.9 S2: looked

0:11:50.1 S2: like

0:11:50.4 S2: old

0:11:50.9 S2: army

0:11:51.4 S2: boots

0:11:52.1 S2: and

0:11:52.5 S2: an

0:11:52.8 S2: army

0:11:54.5 S2: jacket.

0:11:56.0 S2: And

0:11:56.2 S2: he

0:11:56.3 S2: said

0:11:57.2 S2: to

0:11:57.5 S2: Billy

0:11:57.9 S2: and

0:11:59.0 S2: Anne...

0:12:01.0 S1: "Why

0:12:01.1 S1: don't

0:12:01.4 S1: you

0:12:01.5 S1: come

0:12:01.8 S1: into

0:12:02.3 S1: the

0:12:02.5 S1: house,

0:12:03.4 S1: and

0:12:03.5 S1: I'll

0:12:03.8 S1: make

0:12:04.0 S1: us

0:12:04.2 S1: some

0:12:04.7 S1: lemonade?"

0:12:05.5 S1: Billy

0:12:06.1 S1: looked

0:12:06.7 S1: at

0:12:07.0 S1: Anne,

0:12:07.4 S1: and

0:12:07.6 S1: Anne

0:12:08.4 S1: made

0:12:08.6 S1: a

0:12:08.9 S1: quick

0:12:09.3 S1: shake

0:12:09.5 S1: of

0:12:09.7 S1: the

0:12:09.8 S1: head

0:12:10.1 S1: gesture

0:12:10.6 S1: to

0:12:10.7 S1: indicate

0:12:11.2 S1: that

0:12:11.4 S1: they

0:12:11.6 S1: shouldn't

0:12:12.0 S1: do

0:12:12.2 S1: this,

0:12:13.3 S1: but

0:12:13.6 S1: Billy

0:12:14.1 S1: squeezed

0:12:14.5 S1: Anne's

0:12:14.9 S1: hand

0:12:15.1 S1: more

0:12:15.5 S1: tightly

0:12:16.1 S1: and

0:12:16.4 S1: said,

0:12:17.0 S1: "We

0:12:17.2 S1: would

0:12:17.4 S1: love

0:12:17.7 S1: to."

0:12:18.0 S1: So

0:12:18.6 S1: Billy

0:12:19.6 S1: and

0:12:20.0 S1: Anne

0:12:20.0 S1: went

0:12:20.3 S1: into

0:12:20.8 S1: old

0:12:21.1 S1: man

0:12:21.3 S1: Caruthers'

0:12:21.9 S1: house

0:12:22.5 S1: and

0:12:22.9 S1: old

0:12:23.2 S1: man

0:12:23.5 S1: Caruthers

0:12:24.2 S1: shut

0:12:24.5 S1: the

0:12:24.7 S1: door.

0:12:25.6 S1: He

0:12:25.8 S1: turned

0:12:26.2 S1: towards

0:12:26.6 S1: the

0:12:26.8 S1: kitchen

0:12:27.5 S1: and

0:12:27.7 S1: walked

0:12:28.5 S1: slowly

0:12:29.3 S1: away.

0:12:32.2 S2: Billy

0:12:32.6 S2: and

0:12:32.8 S2: Anne

0:12:32.8 S2: followed

0:12:33.2 S2: him

0:12:33.4 S2: into

0:12:33.6 S2: the

0:12:33.7 S2: kitchen,

0:12:35.8 S2: and

0:12:36.4 S2: the

0:12:36.7 S2: old

0:12:36.9 S2: man

0:12:37.1 S2: opened

0:12:37.5 S2: up

0:12:39.0 S2: his

0:12:39.7 S2: refrigerator

0:12:41.0 S2: and

0:12:41.5 S2: pulled

0:12:41.8 S2: out

0:12:42.3 S2: a

0:12:42.7 S2: giant

0:12:43.2 S2: sack

0:12:43.5 S2: of

0:12:43.6 S2: lemons,

0:12:45.6 S2: and

0:12:46.8 S2: put

0:12:47.6 S2: the

0:12:47.8 S2: lemons

0:12:48.2 S2: on

0:12:49.3 S2: the

0:12:49.6 S2: counter

0:12:50.5 S2: and

0:12:50.6 S2: began

0:12:51.0 S2: cutting

0:12:51.3 S2: them

0:12:51.4 S2: open.

0:12:53.7 S2: The

0:12:53.8 S2: old

0:12:54.0 S2: man

0:12:54.3 S2: then

0:12:54.6 S2: said,

0:12:55.8 S2: "That

0:12:56.0 S2: does

0:12:56.4 S2: sound

0:12:56.7 S2: like

0:12:57.0 S2: my

0:12:57.2 S2: dog,

0:12:59.0 S2: and

0:12:59.1 S2: I

0:12:59.3 S2: haven't... "

0:13:01.5 S1: "Seen

0:13:01.9 S1: him

0:13:02.3 S1: in

0:13:02.4 S1: a

0:13:02.5 S1: couple

0:13:02.7 S1: of

0:13:03.0 S1: days,

0:13:03.7 S1: and

0:13:03.9 S1: I've

0:13:04.1 S1: been

0:13:04.3 S1: very,

0:13:04.7 S1: very

0:13:05.1 S1: worried."

0:13:08.0 S1: As

0:13:08.3 S1: Billy

0:13:08.6 S1: and

0:13:08.8 S1: Anne

0:13:09.0 S1: sat

0:13:09.8 S1: there

0:13:10.4 S1: listening

0:13:10.8 S1: to

0:13:11.0 S1: old

0:13:11.2 S1: man

0:13:11.4 S1: Caruthers

0:13:12.0 S1: and

0:13:12.2 S1: seeing

0:13:12.6 S1: him

0:13:12.8 S1: cut

0:13:12.9 S1: up

0:13:13.1 S1: lemons,

0:13:14.2 S1: their

0:13:14.5 S1: eyes

0:13:15.2 S1: wandered

0:13:15.6 S1: around

0:13:15.9 S1: the

0:13:16.0 S1: room,

0:13:16.5 S1: and

0:13:16.8 S1: saw

0:13:17.0 S1: lots

0:13:17.3 S1: of

0:13:17.5 S1: old

0:13:18.1 S1: photographs

0:13:19.5 S1: of

0:13:19.9 S1: old

0:13:20.1 S1: man

0:13:20.3 S1: Caruthers

0:13:20.9 S1: as

0:13:21.1 S1: a

0:13:21.2 S1: younger

0:13:21.7 S1: man

0:13:22.4 S1: with

0:13:22.6 S1: little

0:13:22.9 S1: children,

0:13:24.1 S1: and

0:13:24.3 S1: also

0:13:24.8 S1: old

0:13:25.1 S1: man

0:13:25.4 S1: Caruthers

0:13:26.1 S1: with

0:13:26.3 S1: his

0:13:26.6 S1: army

0:13:27.3 S1: friends

0:13:27.8 S1: at

0:13:28.0 S1: some

0:13:28.4 S1: sort

0:13:28.7 S1: of

0:13:28.8 S1: war.

0:13:31.5 S2: And

0:13:31.7 S2: they

0:13:31.9 S2: also

0:13:32.2 S2: saw

0:13:32.4 S2: a

0:13:32.5 S2: picture

0:13:32.9 S2: of

0:13:33.0 S2: him,

0:13:35.0 S2: which

0:13:35.3 S2: looked

0:13:35.5 S2: like

0:13:35.7 S2: it

0:13:35.8 S2: was

0:13:36.1 S2: maybe

0:13:36.5 S2: 10

0:13:36.7 S2: years

0:13:37.0 S2: old,

0:13:38.3 S2: with

0:13:38.5 S2: the

0:13:38.7 S2: tiny

0:13:39.0 S2: little

0:13:39.3 S2: dog.

0:13:40.7 S2: When

0:13:40.9 S2: Billy

0:13:41.3 S2: saw

0:13:41.5 S2: this,

0:13:41.8 S2: he

0:13:42.0 S2: jumped

0:13:42.2 S2: up

0:13:42.4 S2: and

0:13:42.6 S2: said,

0:13:43.0 S2: "It

0:13:43.1 S2: is

0:13:43.3 S2: your

0:13:43.5 S2: dog."

0:13:45.7 S2: And

0:13:46.3 S2: then

0:13:46.5 S2: he

0:13:46.7 S2: told

0:13:46.9 S2: the

0:13:47.1 S2: story

0:13:47.5 S2: of

0:13:47.8 S2: what

0:13:48.0 S2: happened,

0:13:48.5 S2: that

0:13:48.7 S2: he

0:13:48.8 S2: had

0:13:48.9 S2: just

0:13:49.2 S2: found

0:13:49.4 S2: the

0:13:49.5 S2: dog

0:13:49.8 S2: when

0:13:49.9 S2: he

0:13:50.1 S2: was

0:13:50.2 S2: walking

0:13:50.5 S2: to

0:13:50.6 S2: the

0:13:51.4 S2: school,

0:13:52.5 S2: tried

0:13:52.8 S2: to

0:13:52.9 S2: take

0:13:53.1 S2: care

0:13:53.3 S2: of

0:13:53.4 S2: it

0:13:53.5 S2: during

0:13:53.8 S2: the

0:13:53.9 S2: day,

0:13:55.0 S2: but

0:13:55.2 S2: ran

0:13:55.5 S2: off

0:13:55.8 S2: when

0:13:55.9 S2: the

0:13:56.1 S2: teachers

0:13:56.5 S2: interfered.

0:13:57.3 S2: Old

0:13:57.6 S2: man

0:13:58.0 S2: Caruthers

0:13:58.9 S2: laughed

0:13:59.5 S2: and

0:13:59.8 S2: kept

0:14:00.0 S2: on

0:14:00.3 S2: cutting

0:14:00.6 S2: lemons.

0:14:03.6 S1: And

0:14:03.8 S1: just

0:14:04.0 S1: at

0:14:04.2 S1: that

0:14:04.5 S1: moment,

0:14:05.3 S1: there

0:14:05.4 S1: was

0:14:05.6 S1: a

0:14:05.8 S1: scratching

0:14:06.8 S1: sound.

0:14:07.4 S1: They

0:14:07.9 S1: didn't

0:14:08.5 S1: know

0:14:08.7 S1: what

0:14:08.8 S1: it

0:14:09.0 S1: was

0:14:09.2 S1: at

0:14:09.4 S1: first,

0:14:09.8 S1: and

0:14:10.0 S1: Billy

0:14:10.3 S1: looked

0:14:10.6 S1: at

0:14:10.7 S1: Anne,

0:14:10.7 S1: and

0:14:11.2 S1: old

0:14:11.5 S1: man

0:14:11.7 S1: Caruthers

0:14:12.3 S1: seemed

0:14:12.5 S1: like

0:14:12.6 S1: he

0:14:12.8 S1: didn't

0:14:13.1 S1: hear

0:14:13.4 S1: it.

0:14:14.1 S1: But

0:14:14.2 S1: then

0:14:14.4 S1: it

0:14:14.6 S1: kept

0:14:14.9 S1: going,

0:14:15.4 S1: and

0:14:15.6 S1: then

0:14:15.8 S1: there

0:14:16.0 S1: was

0:14:16.2 S1: a

0:14:16.3 S1: yelp.

0:14:17.5 S1: Billy

0:14:18.6 S1: and

0:14:18.9 S1: Anne

0:14:19.0 S1: suddenly

0:14:19.5 S1: stood

0:14:19.8 S1: up

0:14:20.1 S1: and

0:14:20.3 S1: went

0:14:20.5 S1: to

0:14:20.7 S1: the

0:14:20.8 S1: door.

0:14:21.8 S1: They

0:14:22.0 S1: opened

0:14:22.3 S1: the

0:14:22.5 S1: door

0:14:22.9 S1: and

0:14:23.2 S1: there

0:14:23.7 S1: was

0:14:23.9 S1: the

0:14:24.1 S1: dog.

0:14:24.5 S1: Old

0:14:24.9 S1: man

0:14:25.3 S1: Caruthers'

0:14:26.3 S1: eyes

0:14:26.9 S1: lit

0:14:27.1 S1: up,

0:14:27.6 S1: and

0:14:27.8 S1: he

0:14:28.0 S1: saw

0:14:29.2 S1: his

0:14:29.5 S1: own...

0:14:33.9 S2: His

0:14:34.0 S2: own

0:14:34.4 S2: faithful

0:14:35.0 S2: companion

0:14:35.7 S2: of

0:14:35.9 S2: many

0:14:36.2 S2: years

0:14:37.0 S2: had

0:14:37.2 S2: returned

0:14:37.8 S2: home.

0:14:40.3 S2: Old

0:14:40.6 S2: man

0:14:40.9 S2: Caruthers

0:14:42.5 S2: continued

0:14:43.2 S2: cutting

0:14:43.6 S2: lemons

0:14:44.8 S2: and

0:14:45.2 S2: Billy

0:14:45.8 S2: and

0:14:46.0 S2: Anne

0:14:46.0 S2: realized

0:14:47.0 S2: that

0:14:48.9 S2: their

0:14:49.2 S2: work

0:14:49.7 S2: there

0:14:50.1 S2: was

0:14:50.4 S2: done.

0:14:51.4 S2: They

0:14:51.9 S2: bid

0:14:52.2 S2: the

0:14:52.3 S2: old

0:14:52.5 S2: man

0:14:52.8 S2: farewell

0:14:53.9 S2: and

0:14:54.7 S2: returned

0:14:55.3 S2: to

0:14:55.4 S2: their

0:14:55.7 S2: parents

0:14:56.2 S2: to

0:14:56.4 S2: tell

0:14:56.6 S2: them

0:14:56.8 S2: what
