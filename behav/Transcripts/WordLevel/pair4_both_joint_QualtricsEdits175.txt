0:00:00.0 S1: Oh

0:00:00.5 S1: man,

0:00:00.9 S1: I'm

0:00:01.1 S1: always

0:00:01.3 S1: the

0:00:01.5 S1: starter.

0:00:02.0 S1: Alright,

0:00:02.5 S1: so

0:00:02.8 S1: once

0:00:03.3 S1: upon

0:00:03.8 S1: a

0:00:03.9 S1: time,

0:00:04.7 S1: there

0:00:04.9 S1: was

0:00:05.0 S1: a

0:00:05.2 S1: family

0:00:06.0 S1: known

0:00:06.4 S1: as

0:00:06.8 S1: the

0:00:07.4 S1: Joneses.

0:00:08.1 S1: And

0:00:08.6 S1: this

0:00:08.9 S1: was

0:00:09.0 S1: a

0:00:09.2 S1: very,

0:00:09.6 S1: very

0:00:10.0 S1: ordinary

0:00:10.6 S1: family:

0:00:11.2 S1: They

0:00:11.3 S1: had

0:00:11.5 S1: a

0:00:11.6 S1: white

0:00:11.9 S1: picket

0:00:12.9 S1: fence,

0:00:13.5 S1: they

0:00:13.8 S1: lived

0:00:14.1 S1: in

0:00:14.6 S1: Maryland...

0:00:15.5 S1: The

0:00:15.7 S1: State

0:00:15.9 S1: of

0:00:16.1 S1: Maryland,

0:00:17.1 S1: and

0:00:17.2 S1: everything

0:00:17.6 S1: was

0:00:17.8 S1: pretty

0:00:18.1 S1: normal.

0:00:18.4 S1: You

0:00:18.5 S1: had

0:00:18.7 S1: a

0:00:18.8 S1: mom,

0:00:19.1 S1: a

0:00:19.2 S1: dad,

0:00:20.9 S1: a

0:00:21.3 S1: big

0:00:21.3 S1: sister,

0:00:22.7 S1: big

0:00:23.0 S1: brother...

0:00:23.9 S1: But

0:00:24.1 S1: then

0:00:24.4 S1: one

0:00:25.0 S1: little

0:00:25.3 S1: brother

0:00:25.8 S1: named

0:00:26.9 S1: Tommy.

0:00:30.4 S1: Tommy!

0:00:28.8 S1: Tommy

0:00:31.3 S1: was

0:00:31.5 S1: about

0:00:32.0 S1: seven,

0:00:32.5 S1: and

0:00:32.9 S1: he

0:00:33.2 S1: really

0:00:33.9 S1: enjoyed

0:00:34.6 S1: playing

0:00:35.4 S1: in

0:00:35.7 S1: the

0:00:36.1 S1: woods.

0:00:36.7 S1: However,

0:00:37.4 S1: his

0:00:37.8 S1: family

0:00:38.4 S1: didn't

0:00:38.7 S1: know

0:00:38.9 S1: about

0:00:39.2 S1: this,

0:00:39.4 S1: so

0:00:39.7 S1: Tommy

0:00:40.2 S1: would

0:00:40.6 S1: skip

0:00:41.0 S1: school

0:00:41.5 S1: sometimes,

0:00:42.3 S1: or

0:00:42.7 S1: on

0:00:42.9 S1: the

0:00:43.0 S1: way

0:00:43.2 S1: back

0:00:43.5 S1: home,

0:00:44.5 S1: he

0:00:44.7 S1: would

0:00:44.9 S1: go

0:00:45.1 S1: to

0:00:45.3 S1: the

0:00:45.4 S1: woods

0:00:45.7 S1: and

0:00:45.9 S1: play

0:00:46.1 S1: around.

0:00:46.6 S1: Like,

0:00:46.9 S1: build

0:00:47.2 S1: his

0:00:47.6 S1: own

0:00:48.1 S1: little

0:00:49.1 S1: houses,

0:00:49.9 S1: and

0:00:50.8 S1: like...

0:00:51.0 S1: Track

0:00:51.8 S1: animals,

0:00:53.1 S1: and

0:00:53.8 S1: this

0:00:54.6 S1: kind

0:00:55.4 S1: of

0:00:55.8 S1: stuff,

0:00:56.8 S1: you

0:00:57.5 S1: know?

0:00:58.3 S1: So

0:00:58.6 S1: one

0:01:00.1 S1: day,

0:01:00.1 S1: he

0:01:00.1 S1: started

0:01:00.1 S1: to...

0:01:00.1 S1: He

0:01:00.3 S1: started

0:01:00.6 S1: to

0:01:00.8 S1: build

0:01:02.0 S1: a

0:01:02.3 S1: new

0:01:02.8 S1: house

0:01:03.5 S1: for

0:01:03.9 S1: the

0:01:04.4 S1: squirrels.

0:01:04.9 S1: He's

0:01:05.1 S1: like,

0:01:05.2 S1: "You

0:01:05.3 S1: know

0:01:05.4 S1: what,

0:01:05.6 S1: the

0:01:05.7 S1: squirrels

0:01:06.0 S1: are

0:01:06.1 S1: my

0:01:06.2 S1: friends,

0:01:06.5 S1: I

0:01:06.6 S1: want

0:01:06.8 S1: them

0:01:07.0 S1: to

0:01:07.1 S1: have

0:01:07.2 S1: a

0:01:07.3 S1: house."

0:01:07.8 S1: But

0:01:08.4 S1: he

0:01:08.8 S1: needed

0:01:09.7 S1: the

0:01:10.0 S1: materials.

0:01:10.8 S1: He's

0:01:11.0 S1: like,

0:01:11.1 S1: "Where

0:01:11.3 S1: am

0:01:11.4 S1: I

0:01:11.5 S1: gonna

0:01:11.8 S1: get

0:01:12.0 S1: the

0:01:12.1 S1: materials

0:01:13.0 S1: to

0:01:13.9 S1: build

0:01:14.2 S1: a

0:01:14.3 S1: nice

0:01:14.6 S1: shelter

0:01:15.1 S1: for

0:01:15.4 S1: my

0:01:15.6 S1: friends,

0:01:16.1 S1: the

0:01:16.4 S1: squirrels?

0:01:17.1 S1: So

0:01:17.3 S1: I've

0:01:17.6 S1: got

0:01:17.8 S1: these

0:01:18.1 S1: things

0:01:18.5 S1: around

0:01:18.9 S1: me

0:01:19.0 S1: in

0:01:19.2 S1: nature.

0:01:19.5 S1: There's

0:01:20.6 S1: a

0:01:20.7 S1: lot

0:01:20.8 S1: of...

0:01:21.0 S1: A

0:01:21.0 S1: lot

0:01:21.3 S1: of

0:01:21.4 S1: twigs

0:01:21.7 S1: and

0:01:21.8 S1: things

0:01:22.1 S1: like

0:01:22.3 S1: that,

0:01:22.5 S1: but

0:01:22.7 S1: I

0:01:22.9 S1: feel

0:01:23.1 S1: like

0:01:23.2 S1: I

0:01:23.4 S1: need

0:01:23.9 S1: more

0:01:24.1 S1: materials

0:01:25.0 S1: to

0:01:25.2 S1: make

0:01:25.4 S1: this

0:01:25.6 S1: a

0:01:25.7 S1: nice

0:01:26.1 S1: place

0:01:26.4 S1: for

0:01:26.5 S1: the

0:01:26.7 S1: squirrels."

0:01:28.9 S1: Then

0:01:29.8 S1: he

0:01:30.0 S1: reminded

0:01:30.4 S1: himself,

0:01:31.1 S1: "Oh,

0:01:31.6 S1: there

0:01:31.8 S1: are

0:01:32.2 S1: lumberjacks!

0:01:33.0 S1: They're

0:01:33.6 S1: people

0:01:34.0 S1: who

0:01:34.6 S1: cut

0:01:35.0 S1: trees

0:01:35.5 S1: to

0:01:35.7 S1: get

0:01:36.0 S1: lumber.

0:01:36.6 S1: He

0:01:36.9 S1: decided

0:01:37.6 S1: to

0:01:37.9 S1: visit

0:01:38.4 S1: one

0:01:38.6 S1: of

0:01:38.7 S1: the

0:01:39.3 S1: places

0:01:39.9 S1: where

0:01:40.1 S1: they

0:01:40.3 S1: actually

0:01:41.2 S1: cut

0:01:41.5 S1: trees,

0:01:42.0 S1: and

0:01:42.2 S1: he

0:01:42.5 S1: followed

0:01:43.1 S1: the

0:01:43.3 S1: lumberjack

0:01:44.3 S1: back

0:01:44.8 S1: to

0:01:45.1 S1: the

0:01:45.4 S1: mill

0:01:45.9 S1: to

0:01:46.2 S1: see

0:01:46.5 S1: what

0:01:46.6 S1: is

0:01:46.9 S1: happening

0:01:47.3 S1: with

0:01:47.7 S1: all

0:01:48.0 S1: the

0:01:48.3 S1: trees

0:01:48.8 S1: and

0:01:48.9 S1: the

0:01:49.1 S1: wood

0:01:49.4 S1: and

0:01:49.7 S1: lumber

0:01:50.8 S1: that

0:01:51.1 S1: they

0:01:51.9 S1: cut.

0:01:52.3 S1: So

0:01:53.1 S1: he

0:01:53.3 S1: found

0:01:53.6 S1: the

0:01:53.8 S1: place

0:01:54.1 S1: that

0:01:54.3 S1: they

0:01:54.3 S1: cut

0:01:54.3 S1: the

0:01:56.1 S1: lumber,

0:01:56.9 S1: and

0:01:57.3 S1: he...

0:02:00.9 S1: And

0:02:01.8 S1: Tommy's

0:02:01.9 S1: very

0:02:01.9 S1: sneaky.

0:02:01.9 S1: He

0:02:01.9 S1: found

0:02:01.9 S1: the

0:02:01.9 S1: place

0:02:01.9 S1: where

0:02:01.9 S1: they

0:02:02.0 S1: cut

0:02:02.2 S1: the

0:02:02.3 S1: lumber,

0:02:02.7 S1: but

0:02:02.9 S1: the

0:02:03.0 S1: lumberjack

0:02:03.6 S1: didn't

0:02:04.0 S1: know

0:02:04.7 S1: that

0:02:04.9 S1: this

0:02:05.1 S1: little

0:02:05.4 S1: seven-

0:02:05.7 S1: year-

0:02:05.9 S1: old

0:02:06.1 S1: boy

0:02:06.7 S1: was

0:02:07.1 S1: following

0:02:07.3 S1: him.

0:02:08.1 S1: So

0:02:08.3 S1: Tommy

0:02:08.3 S1: managed

0:02:08.3 S1: to

0:02:09.1 S1: actually

0:02:09.5 S1: sneak

0:02:10.5 S1: into

0:02:10.9 S1: the

0:02:11.0 S1: lumberjack's

0:02:11.7 S1: house.

0:02:12.6 S1: He's

0:02:12.8 S1: following

0:02:13.1 S1: around...

0:02:13.4 S1: He's

0:02:13.6 S1: not

0:02:13.8 S1: trying

0:02:14.1 S1: to

0:02:14.2 S1: be

0:02:14.3 S1: bad,

0:02:14.5 S1: he's

0:02:14.7 S1: just...

0:02:14.9 S1: He's

0:02:15.0 S1: very

0:02:15.3 S1: curious

0:02:15.8 S1: about

0:02:16.3 S1: the

0:02:16.6 S1: lumberjack's

0:02:17.5 S1: work,

0:02:17.8 S1: how

0:02:18.1 S1: the

0:02:18.4 S1: lumberjack

0:02:19.2 S1: cuts

0:02:19.5 S1: the

0:02:19.6 S1: wood,

0:02:19.8 S1: and

0:02:20.0 S1: the

0:02:20.1 S1: different

0:02:20.4 S1: kinds

0:02:20.7 S1: of

0:02:20.9 S1: wood,

0:02:21.7 S1: and

0:02:21.9 S1: things

0:02:22.1 S1: like

0:02:22.3 S1: that,

0:02:22.7 S1: but...

0:02:23.0 S1: He's

0:02:23.9 S1: so

0:02:24.2 S1: quiet,

0:02:24.5 S1: and

0:02:24.7 S1: he's

0:02:25.0 S1: so

0:02:25.2 S1: sneaky,

0:02:25.6 S1: and

0:02:25.8 S1: he's

0:02:26.1 S1: kinda

0:02:26.4 S1: small,

0:02:26.7 S1: but

0:02:26.9 S1: nobody

0:02:27.3 S1: sees

0:02:27.6 S1: him.

0:02:27.9 S1: He's

0:02:28.2 S1: able

0:02:28.3 S1: to

0:02:28.4 S1: walk

0:02:28.6 S1: around

0:02:28.8 S1: undetected.

0:02:31.6 S1: Yeah,

0:02:31.9 S1: so

0:02:32.1 S1: he

0:02:32.3 S1: spent

0:02:32.9 S1: some

0:02:33.0 S1: time

0:02:33.3 S1: in

0:02:33.4 S1: the...

0:02:33.6 S1: In

0:02:33.7 S1: the

0:02:33.9 S1: lumberjack's

0:02:34.4 S1: house,

0:02:34.7 S1: and

0:02:34.9 S1: he

0:02:35.1 S1: also

0:02:35.6 S1: went

0:02:35.9 S1: to

0:02:36.1 S1: his

0:02:36.3 S1: garage

0:02:36.9 S1: when

0:02:37.2 S1: the

0:02:37.4 S1: lumberjack

0:02:38.0 S1: was

0:02:38.3 S1: making

0:02:38.8 S1: his

0:02:39.2 S1: own

0:02:39.6 S1: little

0:02:40.3 S1: sculptures.

0:02:41.3 S1: And

0:02:41.7 S1: he

0:02:41.8 S1: was

0:02:42.0 S1: making

0:02:42.3 S1: sculptures

0:02:44.0 S1: of

0:02:44.3 S1: squirrels

0:02:44.5 S1: and...

0:02:45.3 S1: The

0:02:45.5 S1: rabbits

0:02:46.1 S1: and

0:02:46.3 S1: all

0:02:46.5 S1: of

0:02:46.7 S1: the

0:02:46.8 S1: other

0:02:47.1 S1: animal

0:02:47.5 S1: life

0:02:47.8 S1: that

0:02:48.0 S1: you

0:02:48.1 S1: could

0:02:48.7 S1: see

0:02:49.1 S1: in

0:02:49.4 S1: the

0:02:49.8 S1: woods.

0:02:50.4 S1: And

0:02:50.8 S1: little

0:02:51.5 S1: Tommy

0:02:52.1 S1: was

0:02:52.5 S1: so

0:02:52.8 S1: enchanted

0:02:53.8 S1: with

0:02:53.9 S1: this

0:02:54.3 S1: that

0:02:54.6 S1: he

0:02:54.8 S1: actually

0:02:55.4 S1: took

0:02:55.7 S1: one

0:02:55.9 S1: of

0:02:56.2 S1: these

0:02:56.7 S1: wooden

0:02:57.6 S1: squirrels

0:02:57.8 S1: with

0:02:57.9 S1: him

0:02:58.0 S1: to

0:02:58.0 S1: put

0:02:58.1 S1: it

0:02:58.2 S1: in

0:02:58.2 S1: the

0:02:58.3 S1: squirrel

0:02:58.5 S1: house.

0:03:00.7 S1: He

0:02:58.7 S1: thought,

0:02:58.8 S1: "This

0:02:59.1 S1: would

0:02:59.5 S1: be

0:02:59.7 S1: perfect!

0:03:00.4 S1: Look

0:03:00.7 S1: at

0:03:01.0 S1: this

0:03:01.3 S1: squirrel!

0:03:02.0 S1: It'll

0:03:02.5 S1: be,

0:03:02.7 S1: like,

0:03:03.1 S1: on

0:03:03.3 S1: the

0:03:03.6 S1: mantelpiece

0:03:04.6 S1: of

0:03:04.8 S1: my

0:03:05.0 S1: little

0:03:05.3 S1: squirrel

0:03:06.4 S1: house."

0:03:07.0 S1: And

0:03:07.2 S1: he...

0:03:07.3 S1: He

0:03:07.4 S1: didn't

0:03:07.6 S1: think

0:03:07.7 S1: the

0:03:08.2 S1: lumberjack

0:03:08.8 S1: would

0:03:09.2 S1: mind;

0:03:09.5 S1: the

0:03:09.7 S1: lumberjack

0:03:10.4 S1: had

0:03:10.6 S1: so

0:03:10.9 S1: many.

0:03:12.2 S1: So

0:03:12.8 S1: he

0:03:12.8 S1: took

0:03:12.8 S1: this

0:03:13.1 S1: little

0:03:13.5 S1: one

0:03:13.8 S1: right

0:03:14.3 S1: at

0:03:14.7 S1: the

0:03:15.2 S1: end,

0:03:15.7 S1: and

0:03:15.9 S1: he

0:03:16.7 S1: scurried

0:03:17.2 S1: away

0:03:17.5 S1: back

0:03:17.8 S1: to

0:03:17.9 S1: his

0:03:18.1 S1: squirrel

0:03:18.5 S1: house.

0:03:18.9 S1: But

0:03:19.1 S1: what

0:03:19.3 S1: he

0:03:19.5 S1: didn't

0:03:19.9 S1: know

0:03:20.6 S1: is

0:03:20.7 S1: that

0:03:20.9 S1: the

0:03:21.0 S1: lumberjack

0:03:21.5 S1: was

0:03:21.7 S1: actually

0:03:22.1 S1: making

0:03:22.5 S1: that

0:03:22.7 S1: one

0:03:23.2 S1: special

0:03:24.1 S1: for

0:03:24.4 S1: his

0:03:24.6 S1: daughter.

0:03:25.1 S1: It

0:03:25.3 S1: had

0:03:25.5 S1: a

0:03:25.6 S1: special

0:03:26.1 S1: engraving

0:03:26.6 S1: on

0:03:26.7 S1: the

0:03:26.9 S1: bottom

0:03:27.2 S1: of

0:03:27.3 S1: it.

0:03:28.0 S1: It

0:03:28.2 S1: was

0:03:28.3 S1: made

0:03:28.6 S1: special

0:03:28.9 S1: for

0:03:29.0 S1: the

0:03:29.1 S1: daughter.

0:03:31.6 S1: So

0:03:31.7 S1: when

0:03:31.9 S1: the

0:03:32.1 S1: lumberjack

0:03:32.8 S1: got

0:03:33.2 S1: back

0:03:34.1 S1: to

0:03:34.5 S1: the

0:03:34.8 S1: garage,

0:03:35.3 S1: and

0:03:35.6 S1: he

0:03:35.8 S1: saw

0:03:36.0 S1: that

0:03:36.2 S1: the

0:03:36.4 S1: squirrel

0:03:36.8 S1: was

0:03:37.0 S1: gone,

0:03:37.2 S1: he

0:03:37.3 S1: got

0:03:37.4 S1: really

0:03:37.6 S1: mad,

0:03:37.7 S1: and

0:03:37.7 S1: he

0:03:40.1 S1: started

0:03:40.5 S1: to

0:03:40.7 S1: shout

0:03:41.2 S1: at

0:03:41.4 S1: everybody:

0:03:42.2 S1: At

0:03:42.4 S1: his

0:03:42.7 S1: daughter,

0:03:43.4 S1: at

0:03:43.7 S1: his

0:03:44.0 S1: wife,

0:03:44.3 S1: and

0:03:44.7 S1: at

0:03:44.8 S1: all

0:03:45.0 S1: the

0:03:45.3 S1: neighbors,

0:03:45.8 S1: asking,

0:03:46.7 S1: "Where

0:03:47.0 S1: is

0:03:47.1 S1: the

0:03:47.3 S1: squirrel?

0:03:47.6 S1: Who

0:03:47.8 S1: saw

0:03:47.9 S1: the

0:03:48.0 S1: robbery?

0:03:48.3 S1: Someone

0:03:48.6 S1: took

0:03:48.7 S1: my

0:03:48.8 S1: squirrel!"

0:03:49.1 S1: And

0:03:50.2 S1: actually,

0:03:53.0 S1: one

0:03:54.0 S1: of

0:03:54.1 S1: the

0:03:54.3 S1: neighbors

0:03:54.8 S1: saw

0:03:55.2 S1: little

0:03:55.8 S1: Tommy

0:03:56.3 S1: going

0:03:56.6 S1: out

0:03:56.9 S1: of

0:03:57.0 S1: the

house [0:03:58.8] ____.

0:04:00.4 S1: So

0:04:00.6 S1: he's

0:04:00.8 S1: like,

0:04:01.0 S1: "I

0:04:01.4 S1: saw

0:04:01.7 S1: someone

0:04:02.2 S1: take

0:04:02.3 S1: your

0:04:02.6 S1: squirrel,

0:04:03.0 S1: we

0:04:03.2 S1: need

0:04:03.3 S1: to

0:04:03.5 S1: find

0:04:03.9 S1: this...

0:04:05.5 S1: This

0:04:05.6 S1: little

0:04:05.7 S1: boy!"

0:04:05.8 S1: Because

0:04:05.9 S1: the

0:04:05.9 S1: neighbor

0:04:06.1 S1: didn't

0:04:06.2 S1: recognize

0:04:06.6 S1: his

0:04:06.9 S1: face,

0:04:07.1 S1: so

0:04:07.3 S1: they

0:04:07.4 S1: decide

0:04:07.7 S1: to

0:04:07.9 S1: organize

0:04:08.7 S1: a

0:04:09.0 S1: search

0:04:09.5 S1: party.

0:04:09.9 S1: Tommy

0:04:10.3 S1: also

0:04:10.6 S1: looked

0:04:11.1 S1: very

0:04:11.4 S1: dirty

0:04:11.8 S1: 'cause

0:04:12.3 S1: he

0:04:12.5 S1: had

0:04:12.8 S1: been

0:04:13.1 S1: playing

0:04:13.6 S1: in

0:04:13.7 S1: the

0:04:13.8 S1: woods,

0:04:14.1 S1: so

0:04:14.4 S1: he

0:04:14.6 S1: had

0:04:14.9 S1: dirt

0:04:15.3 S1: all

0:04:15.7 S1: over

0:04:16.0 S1: him,

0:04:16.2 S1: and

0:04:16.4 S1: twigs,

0:04:16.8 S1: and...

0:04:17.1 S1: And

0:04:17.4 S1: they're

0:04:18.0 S1: like,

0:04:18.3 S1: "This

0:04:18.7 S1: looks

0:04:19.1 S1: like

0:04:19.4 S1: a

0:04:19.5 S1: wild...

0:04:19.9 S1: A

0:04:20.0 S1: wild

0:04:20.4 S1: forest

0:04:20.9 S1: boy,

0:04:21.1 S1: like

0:04:21.5 S1: a

0:04:21.6 S1: little

0:04:22.1 S1: squirrel...

0:04:22.7 S1: Boy...

0:04:23.0 S1: Stealing

0:04:23.6 S1: squirrels."

0:04:24.3 S1: So

0:04:24.4 S1: they

0:04:24.5 S1: all

0:04:24.8 S1: organized,

0:04:26.1 S1: and

0:04:26.2 S1: they're

0:04:26.4 S1: like,

0:04:26.6 S1: "We

0:04:26.8 S1: have

0:04:26.9 S1: to

0:04:27.1 S1: find

0:04:27.4 S1: this

0:04:27.7 S1: boy

0:04:28.1 S1: that's

0:04:28.7 S1: living

0:04:29.4 S1: in

0:04:29.7 S1: the

0:04:30.1 S1: woods!"

0:04:30.6 S1: Meanwhile,

0:04:31.6 S1: Tommy

0:04:32.1 S1: got

0:04:32.5 S1: back

0:04:33.0 S1: to

0:04:33.3 S1: his

0:04:33.6 S1: playground

0:04:34.7 S1: in

0:04:34.9 S1: the

0:04:35.3 S1: woods.

0:04:35.8 S1: He

0:04:36.0 S1: put

0:04:36.2 S1: the

0:04:36.5 S1: squirrel

0:04:37.1 S1: in

0:04:37.3 S1: the

0:04:37.6 S1: little

0:04:38.0 S1: squirrel

0:04:38.7 S1: house

0:04:39.0 S1: and

0:04:39.3 S1: went

0:04:39.9 S1: back

0:04:40.5 S1: home.

0:04:41.0 S1: He

0:04:41.3 S1: was

0:04:41.6 S1: very

0:04:41.9 S1: excited,

0:04:42.6 S1: so

0:04:44.7 S1: the

0:04:44.9 S1: next

0:04:46.0 S1: day,

0:04:46.2 S1: in

0:04:46.4 S1: the

0:04:46.6 S1: morning,

0:04:47.1 S1: he

0:04:47.2 S1: ran

0:04:47.5 S1: back

0:04:47.7 S1: to

0:04:47.9 S1: the

0:04:48.1 S1: woods,

0:04:48.4 S1: and

0:04:48.7 S1: he

0:04:48.9 S1: saw

0:04:49.3 S1: that

0:04:49.5 S1: the

0:04:49.7 S1: squirrels

0:04:50.4 S1: actually

0:04:51.8 S1: has

0:04:52.0 S1: bitten

0:04:52.2 S1: the

0:04:52.3 S1: wooden

0:04:52.4 S1: squirrel,

0:04:52.6 S1: and

0:04:52.9 S1: the

0:04:52.9 S1: squirrel

0:04:53.0 S1: was

0:04:55.9 S1: now

0:05:01.0 S1: so

0:05:01.2 S1: badly

0:05:01.2 S1: destroyed.

0:05:01.3 S1: Oh,

0:05:01.3 S1: the

0:05:01.3 S1: squirrels

0:05:01.4 S1: just

0:05:01.5 S1: were

0:05:01.8 S1: so

0:05:01.9 S1: excited

0:05:02.4 S1: about

0:05:02.6 S1: their

0:05:02.7 S1: little

0:05:02.9 S1: squirrel

0:05:03.5 S1: friend,

0:05:03.9 S1: they

0:05:04.2 S1: clawed

0:05:04.6 S1: at

0:05:04.8 S1: him

0:05:05.1 S1: and

0:05:05.3 S1: all

0:05:05.4 S1: this

0:05:05.7 S1: stuff!"

0:05:06.1 S1: So

0:05:06.2 S1: he

0:05:06.4 S1: was...

0:05:06.6 S1: He

0:05:06.8 S1: was

0:05:07.0 S1: really

0:05:07.3 S1: messy,

0:05:07.6 S1: but

0:05:07.8 S1: Tommy

0:05:08.1 S1: was

0:05:08.3 S1: kind

0:05:08.5 S1: of

0:05:08.6 S1: excited.

0:05:08.9 S1: He

0:05:09.1 S1: was

0:05:09.3 S1: like,

0:05:09.4 S1: "Oh

0:05:09.7 S1: well.

0:05:10.0 S1: At

0:05:10.2 S1: least

0:05:10.5 S1: they

0:05:10.8 S1: really

0:05:11.2 S1: liked...

0:05:11.5 S1: They

0:05:11.7 S1: liked

0:05:12.1 S1: the

0:05:12.3 S1: squirrel,

0:05:12.7 S1: but

0:05:13.2 S1: I

0:05:13.4 S1: wish

0:05:13.6 S1: that

0:05:13.8 S1: it

0:05:13.9 S1: wasn't

0:05:14.1 S1: destroyed.

0:05:14.5 S1: Maybe

0:05:14.7 S1: if

0:05:14.8 S1: I

0:05:15.0 S1: take

0:05:15.2 S1: him

0:05:15.3 S1: back

0:05:15.5 S1: to

0:05:15.6 S1: the

0:05:15.8 S1: lumberjack,

0:05:16.5 S1: the

0:05:16.8 S1: lumberjack

0:05:17.5 S1: has

0:05:17.8 S1: some

0:05:18.0 S1: kind

0:05:18.2 S1: of

0:05:18.4 S1: enamel

0:05:18.7 S1: coating

0:05:19.0 S1: or...

0:05:19.1 S1: Or

0:05:19.2 S1: protection.

0:05:20.2 S1: I

0:05:20.3 S1: can

0:05:20.6 S1: get

0:05:20.8 S1: him

0:05:21.0 S1: fixed,

0:05:21.4 S1: I

0:05:21.5 S1: can...

0:05:21.7 S1: Get

0:05:22.3 S1: him

0:05:23.0 S1: fixed

0:05:23.9 S1: up,

0:05:24.3 S1: and

0:05:24.6 S1: paint

0:05:24.8 S1: him

0:05:24.9 S1: so

0:05:25.0 S1: that

0:05:25.2 S1: he's

0:05:25.4 S1: protected,

0:05:25.7 S1: so

0:05:25.8 S1: the

0:05:25.9 S1: squirrels

0:05:27.1 S1: can't

0:05:27.3 S1: do

0:05:27.5 S1: that

0:05:27.6 S1: again

0:05:28.1 S1: to

0:05:29.1 S1: him.

0:05:30.1 S1: But

0:05:30.4 S1: meanwhile,

0:05:31.4 S1: the

0:05:31.5 S1: lumberjack

0:05:32.1 S1: and

0:05:32.3 S1: all

0:05:32.5 S1: the

0:05:32.7 S1: neighbors

0:05:33.8 S1: got

0:05:34.2 S1: to

0:05:34.5 S1: Tommy's

0:05:35.3 S1: house,

0:05:35.8 S1: and

0:05:35.9 S1: then

0:05:36.3 S1: they

0:05:36.6 S1: asked

0:05:37.4 S1: Tommy's

0:05:37.9 S1: parents,

0:05:38.3 S1: "Oh,

0:05:38.5 S1: so

0:05:38.7 S1: have

0:05:38.9 S1: you

0:05:39.0 S1: seen

0:05:39.9 S1: this

0:05:40.2 S1: little

0:05:40.7 S1: boy

0:05:41.1 S1: with

0:05:41.3 S1: my

0:05:41.6 S1: little

0:05:42.0 S1: squirrel?

0:05:42.6 S1: I

0:05:42.7 S1: was

0:05:43.0 S1: making

0:05:43.4 S1: this

0:05:43.6 S1: one

0:05:43.8 S1: for

0:05:44.0 S1: my

0:05:44.3 S1: daughter's

0:05:46.6 S1: birthday."

0:05:48.3 S1: So

0:05:48.5 S1: the

0:05:48.7 S1: parents

0:05:49.0 S1: said

0:05:49.2 S1: to

0:05:49.3 S1: him,

0:05:49.5 S1: "Well,

0:05:49.8 S1: actually,

0:05:50.2 S1: we

0:05:50.4 S1: do

0:05:50.6 S1: have

0:05:50.8 S1: a

0:05:50.9 S1: little

0:05:51.3 S1: boy,

0:05:51.5 S1: Tommy,

0:05:51.8 S1: and

0:05:52.0 S1: he

0:05:52.2 S1: really

0:05:52.5 S1: likes

0:05:52.8 S1: to

0:05:53.0 S1: play

0:05:53.2 S1: in

0:05:53.2 S1: the

0:05:53.4 S1: woods."

0:05:54.5 S1: So

0:05:54.7 S1: when

0:05:55.8 S1: Tommy

0:05:57.1 S1: was

0:05:58.0 S1: back

0:05:59.1 S1: home,

0:06:00.1 S1: everybody

0:06:00.8 S1: was

0:06:00.9 S1: expecting

0:06:01.2 S1: them.

0:06:01.3 S1: Pretty

0:06:01.5 S1: angry.

0:06:01.6 S1: He

0:06:01.7 S1: walks

0:06:01.8 S1: to

0:06:01.9 S1: the

0:06:02.0 S1: front

0:06:02.2 S1: door,

0:06:02.5 S1: and

0:06:02.6 S1: there's

0:06:02.8 S1: an

0:06:03.1 S1: angry

0:06:03.5 S1: mob

0:06:04.0 S1: in

0:06:04.2 S1: the

0:06:04.4 S1: living

0:06:04.7 S1: room.

0:06:05.1 S1: He's

0:06:05.3 S1: like,

0:06:05.6 S1: "Woah,

0:06:06.1 S1: so

0:06:06.5 S1: many

0:06:07.0 S1: people!

0:06:07.3 S1: We're

0:06:07.5 S1: really

0:06:07.8 S1: meeting

0:06:08.1 S1: the

0:06:08.3 S1: neighbors!

0:06:08.6 S1: I

0:06:08.7 S1: guess

0:06:09.0 S1: mom's

0:06:09.2 S1: having

0:06:09.5 S1: a

0:06:09.6 S1: party."

0:06:10.5 S1: But

0:06:11.1 S1: his

0:06:11.3 S1: mom

0:06:11.6 S1: was

0:06:11.9 S1: not

0:06:12.2 S1: having

0:06:12.4 S1: a

0:06:12.6 S1: party.

0:06:13.3 S1: And

0:06:13.7 S1: they're

0:06:14.4 S1: like,

0:06:15.7 S1: "That's

0:06:16.0 S1: him!

0:06:16.1 S1: That's

0:06:16.1 S1: the

0:06:16.2 S1: little

0:06:16.4 S1: boy

0:06:16.7 S1: that

0:06:16.8 S1: I

0:06:17.0 S1: saw!"

0:06:18.0 S1: And...

0:06:20.6 S1: They

0:06:21.0 S1: decide

0:06:22.5 S1: that...

0:06:22.9 S1: Tommy

0:06:24.5 S1: actually

0:06:24.9 S1: freaks

0:06:25.3 S1: out,

0:06:25.4 S1: he's

0:06:25.6 S1: like,

0:06:25.7 S1: "Oh,

0:06:25.9 S1: no

0:06:25.9 S1: I

0:06:26.3 S1: didn't

0:06:26.5 S1: mean

0:06:26.7 S1: to

0:06:26.8 S1: do

0:06:26.9 S1: anything

0:06:27.3 S1: wrong."

0:06:27.5 S1: So

0:06:27.6 S1: he

0:06:27.7 S1: runs

0:06:27.9 S1: out

0:06:28.1 S1: of

0:06:28.2 S1: the

0:06:28.3 S1: house,

0:06:28.6 S1: he

0:06:28.7 S1: runs

0:06:28.8 S1: away,

0:06:29.0 S1: he

0:06:29.1 S1: doesn't

0:06:29.4 S1: wanna

0:06:29.5 S1: get

0:06:29.7 S1: in

0:06:29.7 S1: trouble.

0:06:31.7 S1: So

0:06:32.0 S1: he

0:06:32.2 S1: runs

0:06:32.5 S1: into

0:06:32.7 S1: the

0:06:32.9 S1: woods

0:06:33.2 S1: but

0:06:33.4 S1: unfortunately,

0:06:34.0 S1: he

0:06:34.3 S1: slips

0:06:34.7 S1: on

0:06:35.0 S1: one

0:06:35.2 S1: of

0:06:35.3 S1: the

0:06:35.5 S1: rocks

0:06:36.4 S1: and

0:06:36.8 S1: falls

0:06:37.1 S1: down

0:06:37.3 S1: to

0:06:37.5 S1: the

0:06:37.6 S1: river.

0:06:38.1 S1: The

0:06:38.2 S1: river

0:06:38.4 S1: takes

0:06:38.6 S1: him

0:06:38.7 S1: a

0:06:39.1 S1: little

0:06:40.3 S1: bit

0:06:41.0 S1: down

0:06:41.7 S1: but

0:06:42.0 S1: he

0:06:42.5 S1: manages

0:06:43.7 S1: to

0:06:44.0 S1: swim

0:06:44.3 S1: out

0:06:44.6 S1: but

0:06:44.9 S1: he

0:06:45.0 S1: is

0:06:45.2 S1: very,

0:06:45.6 S1: very

0:06:46.1 S1: far

0:06:46.4 S1: from

0:06:46.6 S1: home

0:06:47.1 S1: now.

0:06:47.5 S1: So

0:06:47.7 S1: he

0:06:48.0 S1: doesn't

0:06:48.6 S1: know

0:06:48.9 S1: where

0:06:49.3 S1: he

0:06:49.4 S1: is,

0:06:50.3 S1: he

0:06:50.5 S1: cannot

0:06:51.2 S1: find

0:06:51.8 S1: the

0:06:52.2 S1: way

0:06:52.6 S1: back

0:06:53.2 S1: and

0:06:53.6 S1: finally,

0:06:54.5 S1: his

0:06:54.9 S1: parents

0:06:55.7 S1: got

0:06:56.1 S1: to

0:06:56.2 S1: know

0:06:56.3 S1: that

0:06:56.6 S1: he's

0:06:57.1 S1: gone

0:06:57.6 S1: missing

0:06:58.0 S1: because

0:06:58.3 S1: he's

0:06:58.6 S1: not

0:06:58.8 S1: coming

0:06:59.2 S1: back

0:06:59.9 S1: home

0:07:00.4 S1: for

0:07:00.7 S1: too

0:07:01.0 S1: long.

0:07:01.5 S1: Yes.

0:07:01.8 S1: So,

0:07:02.0 S1: everyone's

0:07:02.4 S1: like,

0:07:02.5 S1: "Oh

0:07:02.6 S1: no,

0:07:02.8 S1: you

0:07:03.0 S1: have

0:07:03.3 S1: to

0:07:03.4 S1: find

0:07:03.6 S1: him,

0:07:04.1 S1: he's

0:07:04.3 S1: in

0:07:04.4 S1: trouble

0:07:04.8 S1: but

0:07:05.3 S1: we

0:07:05.4 S1: don't

0:07:05.6 S1: want

0:07:05.7 S1: him

0:07:05.8 S1: to

0:07:06.0 S1: get

0:07:06.1 S1: hurt

0:07:06.3 S1: or

0:07:06.4 S1: lost."

0:07:06.7 S1: So

0:07:06.7 S1: they

0:07:06.7 S1: organize

0:07:06.7 S1: a

0:07:06.9 S1: search

0:07:07.4 S1: party

0:07:07.9 S1: meanwhile

0:07:08.6 S1: Tommy

0:07:09.0 S1: is

0:07:09.2 S1: trying

0:07:09.7 S1: to

0:07:09.8 S1: figure

0:07:10.1 S1: out

0:07:10.2 S1: what

0:07:10.4 S1: to

0:07:10.6 S1: do,

0:07:10.8 S1: he

0:07:10.9 S1: is

0:07:11.1 S1: like "

0:07:11.2 S1: I'm

0:07:11.5 S1: lost,

0:07:11.9 S1: I'm

0:07:12.1 S1: in

0:07:12.2 S1: the

0:07:12.3 S1: middle

0:07:12.5 S1: of

0:07:12.6 S1: the

0:07:12.8 S1: woods."

0:07:13.6 S1: Luckily

0:07:14.6 S1: because

0:07:14.8 S1: he

0:07:15.0 S1: plays

0:07:15.2 S1: in

0:07:15.3 S1: the

0:07:15.4 S1: woods

0:07:15.6 S1: so

0:07:15.8 S1: often,

0:07:16.2 S1: he's

0:07:16.5 S1: pretty

0:07:16.7 S1: familiar

0:07:17.3 S1: with

0:07:17.4 S1: the

0:07:17.5 S1: woods,

0:07:17.8 S1: he

0:07:18.0 S1: knows

0:07:18.2 S1: how

0:07:18.3 S1: to

0:07:18.4 S1: climb

0:07:18.8 S1: trees

0:07:19.2 S1: and

0:07:19.9 S1: what

0:07:20.0 S1: kind

0:07:20.2 S1: of

0:07:20.3 S1: berries

0:07:20.7 S1: are

0:07:20.9 S1: good

0:07:21.1 S1: to

0:07:21.2 S1: eat

0:07:21.4 S1: and

0:07:21.5 S1: what

0:07:21.7 S1: aren't,

0:07:22.1 S1: and

0:07:22.7 S1: he

0:07:23.0 S1: actually

0:07:23.4 S1: has

0:07:23.5 S1: a

0:07:23.6 S1: bunch

0:07:23.9 S1: of

0:07:24.0 S1: his

0:07:24.1 S1: squirrel

0:07:24.5 S1: friends,

0:07:24.8 S1: so

0:07:25.3 S1: he's

0:07:25.5 S1: like,"

0:07:25.6 S1: You

0:07:25.8 S1: know

0:07:25.9 S1: what?

0:07:26.7 S1: Like

0:07:27.0 S1: people,

0:07:27.3 S1: we

0:07:27.4 S1: gotta

0:07:27.7 S1: find

0:07:27.9 S1: a

0:07:28.1 S1: way

0:07:28.4 S1: back

0:07:28.4 S1: but

0:07:28.5 S1: I'm

0:07:28.6 S1: gonna

0:07:28.8 S1: be

0:07:29.1 S1: okay

0:07:29.6 S1: for

0:07:30.0 S1: now."

0:07:30.5 S1: So

0:07:30.7 S1: he

0:07:31.0 S1: spends

0:07:31.8 S1: a

0:07:32.0 S1: day

0:07:32.4 S1: in

0:07:32.7 S1: the

0:07:33.1 S1: woods,

0:07:33.7 S1: he

0:07:34.0 S1: eats

0:07:34.5 S1: the

0:07:34.9 S1: berries,

0:07:35.7 S1: and

0:07:36.1 S1: tries

0:07:36.8 S1: not

0:07:37.2 S1: to

0:07:37.5 S1: go

0:07:37.8 S1: too

0:07:38.2 S1: far

0:07:38.6 S1: away,

0:07:39.0 S1: however,

0:07:39.5 S1: he

0:07:39.7 S1: still

0:07:39.9 S1: doesn't

0:07:40.3 S1: know

0:07:40.5 S1: the

0:07:40.7 S1: way

0:07:40.9 S1: back,

0:07:42.8 S1: but

0:07:43.5 S1: at

0:07:43.6 S1: some

0:07:44.3 S1: point,

0:07:45.1 S1: he

0:07:45.4 S1: hears

0:07:46.2 S1: noises

0:07:47.0 S1: and

0:07:47.2 S1: he

0:07:47.3 S1: gets

0:07:48.4 S1: really,

0:07:49.3 S1: really

0:07:49.3 S1: scared

0:07:49.3 S1: because

0:07:49.6 S1: the

0:07:49.6 S1: noises

0:07:49.6 S1: did

0:07:49.6 S1: not

0:07:49.6 S1: resemble

0:07:49.6 S1: anything

0:07:49.6 S1: that

0:07:49.6 S1: he

0:07:50.9 S1: knows.

0:07:53.4 S1: It's

0:07:53.6 S1: not

0:07:53.7 S1: a

0:07:53.9 S1: squirrel

0:07:54.5 S1: and

0:07:54.6 S1: it's

0:07:55.0 S1: not

0:07:55.7 S1: a

0:07:55.9 S1: rabbit.

0:07:56.6 S1: It

0:07:56.7 S1: has

0:07:57.0 S1: to

0:07:57.1 S1: be

0:07:57.3 S1: something

0:07:57.9 S1: big

0:07:58.1 S1: going

0:07:58.4 S1: out

0:07:58.6 S1: of

0:07:58.8 S1: the

0:07:58.9 S1: woods.

0:08:00.7 S1: So

0:08:00.7 S1: he's

0:08:00.7 S1: is

0:08:00.9 S1: really

0:08:01.4 S1: scared,

0:08:01.7 S1: it's

0:08:01.9 S1: getting

0:08:02.3 S1: kinda

0:08:02.5 S1: dark,

0:08:02.8 S1: he's

0:08:03.1 S1: hearing

0:08:03.5 S1: this

0:08:03.8 S1: big

0:08:04.0 S1: noise,

0:08:04.4 S1: sounds

0:08:04.8 S1: like

0:08:05.1 S1: something

0:08:05.6 S1: really

0:08:05.8 S1: big

0:08:06.0 S1: is

0:08:06.1 S1: coming

0:08:06.3 S1: through

0:08:06.5 S1: the

0:08:06.6 S1: trees,

0:08:07.1 S1: so

0:08:07.2 S1: he

0:08:07.5 S1: scurries

0:08:08.5 S1: up

0:08:08.6 S1: and

0:08:08.8 S1: he

0:08:09.0 S1: climbs

0:08:10.1 S1: the

0:08:10.1 S1: tree

0:08:10.1 S1: just

0:08:10.1 S1: like

0:08:10.1 S1: one

0:08:10.2 S1: of

0:08:10.3 S1: his

0:08:10.6 S1: squirrel

0:08:11.2 S1: friends,

0:08:11.7 S1: so

0:08:11.9 S1: he's

0:08:12.2 S1: in

0:08:12.3 S1: the

0:08:12.5 S1: tree

0:08:12.8 S1: and

0:08:12.9 S1: he's

0:08:13.2 S1: looking

0:08:13.5 S1: down

0:08:14.0 S1: and

0:08:14.6 S1: the

0:08:14.8 S1: noise

0:08:15.0 S1: just

0:08:15.2 S1: gets

0:08:15.5 S1: closer

0:08:16.0 S1: and

0:08:16.2 S1: closer,

0:08:16.8 S1: he's

0:08:17.0 S1: super

0:08:17.2 S1: scared,

0:08:17.5 S1: and

0:08:17.7 S1: he's

0:08:17.9 S1: like "

0:08:18.1 S1: What

0:08:18.3 S1: is

0:08:18.4 S1: this,

0:08:18.6 S1: what

0:08:18.8 S1: is

0:08:19.2 S1: this

0:08:19.7 S1: gonna

0:08:19.9 S1: be?"

0:08:20.3 S1: And

0:08:22.4 S1: it

0:08:22.9 S1: turns

0:08:23.4 S1: out

0:08:24.1 S1: that

0:08:24.4 S1: there

0:08:24.8 S1: is

0:08:25.3 S1: a

0:08:26.4 S1: bear

0:08:27.2 S1: in

0:08:27.4 S1: the

0:08:27.6 S1: woods,

0:08:28.2 S1: walking

0:08:28.5 S1: through

0:08:28.7 S1: the

0:08:28.9 S1: woods.

0:08:30.0 S1: Well,

0:08:31.4 S1: the

0:08:31.6 S1: bear

0:08:32.0 S1: doesn't

0:08:32.6 S1: really

0:08:33.1 S1: take

0:08:33.4 S1: care

0:08:34.0 S1: of

0:08:36.3 S1: Tommy

0:08:39.3 S1: but

0:08:40.8 S1: what

0:08:41.0 S1: he

0:08:41.0 S1: then

0:08:41.0 S1: found

0:08:41.0 S1: is

0:08:41.3 S1: a

0:08:41.4 S1: little

0:08:41.7 S1: squirrel,

0:08:42.1 S1: the

0:08:42.3 S1: wooden

0:08:42.6 S1: squirrel

0:08:43.1 S1: that

0:08:43.3 S1: Tommy

0:08:43.6 S1: left

0:08:43.8 S1: when

0:08:44.1 S1: he

0:08:44.2 S1: started

0:08:44.5 S1: climbing

0:08:44.7 S1: the

0:08:44.8 S1: tree.

0:08:45.0 S1: So,

0:08:45.0 S1: the

0:08:45.3 S1: bear

0:08:45.3 S1: tries

0:08:45.4 S1: to

0:08:45.4 S1: eat

0:08:45.5 S1: the

0:08:45.6 S1: little

0:08:45.7 S1: squirrel

0:08:45.8 S1: but

0:08:45.8 S1: of

0:08:45.9 S1: course,

0:08:46.0 S1: it's

0:08:46.0 S1: wooden

0:08:46.1 S1: so

0:08:46.4 S1: it

0:08:47.6 S1: doesn't

0:08:50.7 S1: taste

0:08:52.7 S1: very

0:08:53.0 S1: well.

0:08:53.4 S1: So

0:08:54.3 S1: well,

0:08:54.7 S1: uninterested,

0:08:55.9 S1: he

0:08:56.1 S1: just

0:08:56.8 S1: walks

0:08:57.3 S1: away

0:08:58.1 S1: because

0:08:58.4 S1: there's

0:08:58.7 S1: nothing

0:08:59.8 S1: for

0:09:00.3 S1: him.

0:09:00.9 S1: But

0:09:01.3 S1: at

0:09:01.3 S1: this

0:09:01.6 S1: point,

0:09:02.0 S1: so

0:09:02.1 S1: the

0:09:02.3 S1: bear's

0:09:02.5 S1: gone,

0:09:02.7 S1: Tommy's

0:09:03.0 S1: like "

0:09:03.2 S1: Woah,

0:09:03.4 S1: that

0:09:03.5 S1: was

0:09:03.7 S1: a

0:09:03.9 S1: close

0:09:04.6 S1: one,

0:09:04.9 S1: that

0:09:05.0 S1: could

0:09:05.2 S1: have

0:09:05.3 S1: been

0:09:05.4 S1: really

0:09:05.6 S1: bad.

0:09:06.4 S1: I

0:09:06.5 S1: didn't

0:09:06.6 S1: know

0:09:06.8 S1: there

0:09:07.0 S1: were

0:09:07.2 S1: bears

0:09:07.4 S1: in

0:09:07.6 S1: these

0:09:07.8 S1: woods,

0:09:08.0 S1: that

0:09:08.2 S1: seems

0:09:08.6 S1: unsafe."

0:09:10.0 S1: But

0:09:10.3 S1: he's

0:09:10.7 S1: in

0:09:10.8 S1: the

0:09:11.0 S1: tree

0:09:11.4 S1: now

0:09:11.6 S1: and

0:09:11.7 S1: he's

0:09:11.9 S1: like,

0:09:12.1 S1: "Oh,

0:09:12.4 S1: I'm

0:09:12.6 S1: so

0:09:12.9 S1: high

0:09:13.2 S1: up.

0:09:13.5 S1: I'm

0:09:13.7 S1: like

0:09:13.8 S1: a

0:09:14.0 S1: squirrel,

0:09:14.4 S1: I

0:09:14.5 S1: can

0:09:14.7 S1: maybe

0:09:15.0 S1: see

0:09:15.4 S1: my

0:09:15.6 S1: way

0:09:15.8 S1: home."

0:09:16.3 S1: So

0:09:16.6 S1: he

0:09:16.9 S1: keeps

0:09:17.4 S1: climbing

0:09:18.2 S1: higher

0:09:18.5 S1: and

0:09:18.7 S1: higher,

0:09:19.0 S1: and

0:09:20.0 S1: he's

0:09:20.3 S1: not

0:09:20.4 S1: afraid

0:09:20.7 S1: of

0:09:20.8 S1: heights

0:09:21.1 S1: luckily

0:09:21.5 S1: and

0:09:21.9 S1: he

0:09:21.9 S1: gets

0:09:22.1 S1: to

0:09:22.2 S1: the

0:09:22.3 S1: top

0:09:22.4 S1: of

0:09:22.5 S1: the

0:09:22.6 S1: tree

0:09:22.9 S1: and

0:09:23.1 S1: he

0:09:23.3 S1: realizes, "

0:09:23.8 S1: Oh,

0:09:24.0 S1: I

0:09:24.1 S1: can

0:09:24.3 S1: kinda

0:09:24.7 S1: see,

0:09:24.9 S1: I

0:09:25.0 S1: can

0:09:25.2 S1: see

0:09:25.5 S1: where

0:09:25.8 S1: the

0:09:26.0 S1: river

0:09:26.4 S1: goes,

0:09:26.6 S1: I

0:09:26.7 S1: can

0:09:26.9 S1: see

0:09:27.1 S1: it

0:09:27.2 S1: heads

0:09:27.5 S1: kinda

0:09:27.8 S1: this

0:09:28.0 S1: way.

0:09:28.4 S1: I

0:09:28.4 S1: think

0:09:28.7 S1: that's

0:09:28.9 S1: my

0:09:29.1 S1: neighborhood

0:09:29.6 S1: up

0:09:29.8 S1: there."

0:09:31.8 S1: So

0:09:32.0 S1: finally

0:09:32.5 S1: he

0:09:32.6 S1: knows

0:09:32.9 S1: the

0:09:33.1 S1: direction

0:09:33.6 S1: to

0:09:33.7 S1: go

0:09:33.9 S1: back

0:09:34.2 S1: home

0:09:34.5 S1: but

0:09:34.8 S1: unfortunately,

0:09:35.7 S1: it's

0:09:36.0 S1: not

0:09:36.3 S1: so

0:09:36.4 S1: easy

0:09:36.7 S1: to

0:09:37.3 S1: get

0:09:39.2 S1: down

0:09:41.1 S1: the

0:09:42.6 S1: tree.

0:09:42.9 S1: It

0:09:43.1 S1: was

0:09:43.3 S1: easy

0:09:43.7 S1: to

0:09:43.8 S1: go

0:09:44.0 S1: up

0:09:44.2 S1: but

0:09:44.5 S1: it's

0:09:44.8 S1: not

0:09:45.0 S1: so

0:09:45.2 S1: easy

0:09:45.5 S1: to

0:09:45.7 S1: go

0:09:45.9 S1: down.

0:09:46.2 S1: But

0:09:46.4 S1: luckily

0:09:46.9 S1: he

0:09:47.1 S1: finally

0:09:47.6 S1: hears

0:09:48.0 S1: some

0:09:48.3 S1: people

0:09:48.7 S1: shouting

0:09:49.3 S1: "Tommy,

0:09:49.7 S1: Tommy

0:09:50.0 S1: where

0:09:50.4 S1: are

0:09:50.6 S1: you?

0:09:50.9 S1: Tommy

0:09:51.0 S1: come

0:09:51.2 S1: back

0:09:51.3 S1: we

0:09:51.4 S1: are

0:09:51.5 S1: looking

0:09:51.7 S1: for

0:09:52.1 S1: you."

0:09:53.6 S1: So

0:09:54.6 S1: he

0:09:54.8 S1: starts

0:09:54.9 S1: to

0:09:55.0 S1: scream

0:09:55.1 S1: back "

0:09:55.2 S1: I'm

0:09:55.3 S1: here,

0:09:55.4 S1: I'm

0:09:55.5 S1: here."

0:10:00.3 S1: So

0:09:55.6 S1: he

0:09:55.8 S1: is

0:09:56.2 S1: screaming,

0:09:57.6 S1: "I'm

0:09:58.2 S1: here

0:09:58.9 S1: guys,

0:09:59.6 S1: I'm

0:10:00.1 S1: over

0:10:00.8 S1: here."

0:10:01.4 S1: Unfortunately,

0:10:04.2 S1: the

0:10:04.7 S1: bear

0:10:05.4 S1: hears

0:10:06.2 S1: all

0:10:06.6 S1: of

0:10:06.7 S1: this.

0:10:06.7 S1: Well

0:10:06.7 S1: not

0:10:06.7 S1: fortunately

0:10:06.7 S1: the

0:10:06.7 S1: bear

0:10:06.7 S1: hears

0:10:06.7 S1: the

0:10:07.0 S1: commotion,

0:10:09.3 S1: it

0:10:10.0 S1: scares

0:10:11.4 S1: the

0:10:11.6 S1: bear

0:10:11.6 S1: away.

0:10:11.7 S1: Let's

0:10:11.8 S1: not

0:10:11.8 S1: deal

0:10:11.9 S1: with

0:10:12.0 S1: this

0:10:12.0 S1: bear.

0:10:12.1 S1: The

0:10:12.2 S1: bear

0:10:12.2 S1: runs

0:10:12.3 S1: away,

0:10:12.4 S1: here's

0:10:12.4 S1: all

0:10:12.6 S1: the

0:10:12.7 S1: people

0:10:13.2 S1: coming

0:10:14.3 S1: and

0:10:14.5 S1: the

0:10:14.7 S1: party

0:10:15.0 S1: is

0:10:15.4 S1: like "

0:10:15.8 S1: Oh,

0:10:16.0 S1: you

0:10:16.2 S1: must

0:10:16.5 S1: be

0:10:16.7 S1: this

0:10:17.0 S1: way."

0:10:17.2 S1: So

0:10:18.0 S1: they're

0:10:18.2 S1: kinda

0:10:18.5 S1: getting

0:10:18.8 S1: closer

0:10:19.2 S1: and

0:10:19.3 S1: closer

0:10:19.6 S1: but

0:10:19.8 S1: they

0:10:19.9 S1: can't

0:10:20.3 S1: see

0:10:20.6 S1: him.

0:10:20.8 S1: They

0:10:21.1 S1: are

0:10:21.2 S1: like,

0:10:21.3 S1: "Tommy,

0:10:21.4 S1: wait

0:10:21.5 S1: up.

0:10:21.5 S1: We

0:10:21.8 S1: can

0:10:22.3 S1: hear

0:10:22.8 S1: you

0:10:23.1 S1: but

0:10:23.2 S1: we

0:10:23.5 S1: can't

0:10:24.4 S1: see

0:10:24.4 S1: you.

0:10:24.4 S1: Where

0:10:24.6 S1: are

0:10:25.0 S1: you?"

0:10:25.8 S1: He's

0:10:25.8 S1: like "

0:10:25.9 S1: I'm

0:10:26.5 S1: up,

0:10:26.8 S1: you

0:10:27.1 S1: got

0:10:27.5 S1: to

0:10:27.7 S1: look

0:10:28.2 S1: up."

0:10:28.4 S1: So

0:10:28.5 S1: they

0:10:28.7 S1: look

0:10:28.9 S1: up

0:10:29.0 S1: and

0:10:29.1 S1: they

0:10:29.3 S1: see

0:10:29.4 S1: him.

0:10:31.4 S1: They

0:10:31.6 S1: look

0:10:31.8 S1: up

0:10:32.0 S1: and

0:10:32.1 S1: they

0:10:32.4 S1: see

0:10:32.6 S1: him

0:10:32.7 S1: but

0:10:32.9 S1: they

0:10:33.1 S1: also

0:10:33.6 S1: see

0:10:33.8 S1: a

0:10:34.0 S1: bear

0:10:34.5 S1: coming

0:10:34.8 S1: in

0:10:35.1 S1: front

0:10:35.3 S1: of

0:10:35.5 S1: them,

0:10:35.9 S1: so

0:10:36.1 S1: there's

0:10:36.5 S1: like

0:10:36.8 S1: four

0:10:37.2 S1: or

0:10:37.4 S1: six

0:10:37.6 S1: people

0:10:38.1 S1: looking

0:10:38.6 S1: for

0:10:38.9 S1: Tommy

0:10:39.3 S1: and

0:10:39.5 S1: the

0:10:39.8 S1: bear

0:10:40.1 S1: coming

0:10:40.6 S1: towards

0:10:41.1 S1: them.

0:10:41.4 S1: The

0:10:41.7 S1: bear's

0:10:42.2 S1: really

0:10:42.6 S1: angry

0:10:43.0 S1: right

0:10:43.4 S1: now

0:10:43.5 S1: because

0:10:44.0 S1: he

0:10:44.3 S1: wouldn't

0:10:44.8 S1: expect

0:10:45.2 S1: these

0:10:45.5 S1: intruders

0:10:46.0 S1: and

0:10:46.2 S1: he

0:10:46.4 S1: starts

0:10:46.8 S1: to

0:10:46.9 S1: rush

0:10:47.5 S1: up

0:10:47.6 S1: the

0:10:47.8 S1: group.

0:10:48.2 S1: Tommy

0:10:49.3 S1: is

0:10:49.7 S1: super

0:10:49.7 S1: scared,

0:10:49.8 S1: he

0:10:49.8 S1: says,

0:10:49.8 S1: "No

0:10:49.8 S1: watch

0:10:49.8 S1: out

0:10:49.8 S1: for

0:10:49.8 S1: the

0:10:49.8 S1: bear,

0:10:49.8 S1: there's

0:10:49.8 S1: a

0:10:50.0 S1: bear

0:10:50.6 S1: coming,

0:10:51.5 S1: no

0:10:51.9 S1: watch

0:10:52.7 S1: out

0:10:53.2 S1: for

0:10:53.7 S1: the

0:10:54.4 S1: bear."

0:10:55.3 S1: But

0:10:55.8 S1: he

0:10:56.0 S1: could

0:10:56.6 S1: not

0:10:57.0 S1: do

0:10:57.3 S1: anything

0:10:58.2 S1: from

0:10:58.7 S1: up

0:10:59.0 S1: the

0:10:59.4 S1: tree.

0:11:00.9 S1: And

0:11:00.1 S1: then

0:11:00.2 S1: he

0:11:00.4 S1: looks

0:11:00.7 S1: around

0:11:01.1 S1: and

0:11:01.4 S1: he

0:11:01.7 S1: sees

0:11:02.1 S1: that

0:11:02.4 S1: there

0:11:02.7 S1: is

0:11:02.8 S1: a

0:11:03.1 S1: hornet's

0:11:04.4 S1: nest

0:11:05.2 S1: right

0:11:06.1 S1: by

0:11:06.6 S1: him,

0:11:07.1 S1: he's

0:11:07.2 S1: so

0:11:07.2 S1: high

0:11:07.2 S1: up,

0:11:07.2 S1: he's

0:11:07.2 S1: really

0:11:07.2 S1: near

0:11:07.2 S1: this

0:11:07.2 S1: hornet's

0:11:07.2 S1: nest

0:11:07.2 S1: and

0:11:07.2 S1: he

0:11:07.2 S1: is

0:11:07.2 S1: like

0:11:07.4 S1: "I

0:11:07.6 S1: have

0:11:08.1 S1: to

0:11:08.4 S1: help

0:11:08.9 S1: them,

0:11:09.3 S1: I

0:11:09.5 S1: have

0:11:10.0 S1: to

0:11:10.3 S1: save

0:11:10.7 S1: them."

0:11:11.2 S1: So

0:11:11.5 S1: Tommy

0:11:12.1 S1: crawls

0:11:12.7 S1: along

0:11:13.3 S1: the

0:11:13.7 S1: edge

0:11:14.2 S1: of

0:11:14.4 S1: this

0:11:14.9 S1: branch

0:11:15.5 S1: and

0:11:17.0 S1: he

0:11:17.2 S1: is

0:11:17.3 S1: balancing

0:11:17.7 S1: and

0:11:17.8 S1: he

0:11:18.0 S1: ends

0:11:18.2 S1: up,

0:11:18.3 S1: he

0:11:18.4 S1: is

0:11:18.5 S1: able

0:11:18.7 S1: to

0:11:18.8 S1: kind

0:11:19.0 S1: of

0:11:19.1 S1: grab

0:11:19.3 S1: the

0:11:19.5 S1: top

0:11:19.6 S1: of

0:11:19.7 S1: the

0:11:19.8 S1: hornet's

0:11:20.3 S1: nest

0:11:20.6 S1: and

0:11:20.8 S1: he

0:11:21.0 S1: gets

0:11:21.2 S1: stung

0:11:21.5 S1: a

0:11:21.6 S1: couple

0:11:21.9 S1: of

0:11:21.9 S1: times

0:11:22.2 S1: on

0:11:22.3 S1: his

0:11:22.5 S1: hands

0:11:22.7 S1: and

0:11:22.8 S1: it

0:11:22.9 S1: really

0:11:23.2 S1: hurts

0:11:23.5 S1: but

0:11:23.7 S1: he

0:11:23.8 S1: has

0:11:24.0 S1: to

0:11:24.1 S1: save

0:11:24.4 S1: the

0:11:24.6 S1: people

0:11:24.9 S1: so

0:11:25.1 S1: he

0:11:25.2 S1: throws

0:11:25.6 S1: the

0:11:25.8 S1: hornet's

0:11:26.2 S1: nest

0:11:26.5 S1: down

0:11:26.7 S1: at

0:11:26.8 S1: the

0:11:27.0 S1: bear

0:11:27.3 S1: and

0:11:27.5 S1: it

0:11:27.6 S1: lands

0:11:27.9 S1: right

0:11:28.2 S1: on

0:11:28.3 S1: the

0:11:28.5 S1: bear's

0:11:29.3 S1: head.

0:11:29.3 S1: And

0:11:30.5 S1: it

0:11:30.9 S1: hit

0:11:31.4 S1: the

0:11:31.9 S1: bear

0:11:32.5 S1: so

0:11:32.9 S1: strongly

0:11:34.1 S1: that

0:11:34.7 S1: the

0:11:35.2 S1: bear

0:11:35.8 S1: just

0:11:36.5 S1: fell

0:11:37.1 S1: down

0:11:37.6 S1: and

0:11:37.9 S1: kind

0:11:38.1 S1: of

0:11:38.4 S1: lost

0:11:38.7 S1: his

0:11:39.0 S1: consciousness,

0:11:40.2 S1: so

0:11:40.5 S1: he

0:11:40.8 S1: was

0:11:41.1 S1: lying

0:11:41.6 S1: there

0:11:42.1 S1: without

0:11:42.5 S1: movement.

0:11:43.6 S1: Well,

0:11:44.2 S1: at

0:11:44.4 S1: this

0:11:44.7 S1: point

0:11:47.1 S1: the

0:11:47.4 S1: entire

0:11:48.0 S1: group

0:11:48.5 S1: was

0:11:48.8 S1: more...

0:11:49.2 S1: Didn't

0:11:49.7 S1: know

0:11:50.1 S1: should

0:11:50.7 S1: they

0:11:51.1 S1: be

0:11:51.3 S1: worried

0:11:51.9 S1: about

0:11:52.3 S1: Tommy

0:11:52.6 S1: or

0:11:52.8 S1: the

0:11:53.0 S1: bear

0:11:53.2 S1: but

0:11:53.4 S1: they

0:11:53.5 S1: discovered

0:11:54.6 S1: that

0:11:54.8 S1: the

0:11:54.9 S1: bear

0:11:55.3 S1: will

0:11:55.6 S1: be

0:11:55.8 S1: fine

0:11:56.1 S1: so

0:11:56.3 S1: they

0:11:56.6 S1: started

0:11:56.9 S1: to

0:11:57.1 S1: take

0:11:57.5 S1: Tommy

0:11:58.0 S1: down

0:11:58.4 S1: from

0:11:58.8 S1: the

0:11:59.1 S1: tree.

0:12:00.5 S1: Yeah,

0:11:59.9 S1: the

0:12:00.2 S1: bear's

0:12:00.7 S1: kinda

0:12:01.2 S1: dazed

0:12:01.7 S1: and

0:12:02.0 S1: confused,

0:12:02.7 S1: got

0:12:03.0 S1: hit

0:12:03.3 S1: by

0:12:03.6 S1: the

0:12:03.8 S1: thing,

0:12:06.1 S1: got

0:12:06.3 S1: stung

0:12:06.6 S1: all

0:12:06.8 S1: a

0:12:06.9 S1: bunch

0:12:07.3 S1: by

0:12:07.4 S1: the

0:12:07.6 S1: bees,

0:12:07.9 S1: he

0:12:08.1 S1: is

0:12:08.2 S1: not

0:12:08.3 S1: messing

0:12:08.6 S1: with

0:12:08.7 S1: anyone

0:12:09.0 S1: anymore,

0:12:10.5 S1: he's

0:12:10.6 S1: out.

0:12:10.7 S1: So,

0:12:11.2 S1: alright,

0:12:11.8 S1: we're

0:12:12.3 S1: gotta

0:12:12.8 S1: figure

0:12:13.4 S1: out

0:12:13.7 S1: how

0:12:13.9 S1: to

0:12:13.9 S1: get

0:12:13.9 S1: Tommy

0:12:13.9 S1: down

0:12:13.9 S1: from

0:12:13.9 S1: this

0:12:13.9 S1: tree.

0:12:13.9 S1: How

0:12:14.0 S1: are

0:12:14.0 S1: we

0:12:14.0 S1: gonna

0:12:14.2 S1: get

0:12:14.3 S1: him

0:12:14.4 S1: down?"

0:12:16.0 S1: So

0:12:17.5 S1: they

0:12:17.9 S1: are

0:12:18.1 S1: not

0:12:18.3 S1: as

0:12:18.5 S1: good

0:12:18.7 S1: of

0:12:18.8 S1: climbers

0:12:19.3 S1: as

0:12:19.4 S1: Tommy

0:12:19.7 S1: 'cause

0:12:19.9 S1: they

0:12:20.0 S1: don't

0:12:20.5 S1: live

0:12:20.9 S1: in

0:12:21.1 S1: the

0:12:21.3 S1: woods

0:12:22.2 S1: but

0:12:22.5 S1: the

0:12:22.7 S1: lumberjack

0:12:24.0 S1: is

0:12:24.2 S1: like

0:12:24.4 S1: "Well,

0:12:24.5 S1: I

0:12:24.7 S1: could

0:12:25.0 S1: cut

0:12:25.2 S1: the

0:12:25.3 S1: tree

0:12:25.8 S1: down."

0:12:26.7 S1: His

0:12:26.9 S1: friends

0:12:27.2 S1: are

0:12:27.4 S1: like,

0:12:27.5 S1: "No,

0:12:27.7 S1: I

0:12:27.8 S1: don't

0:12:28.0 S1: think

0:12:28.1 S1: that's

0:12:28.3 S1: a

0:12:28.4 S1: good

0:12:28.6 S1: idea.

0:12:29.8 S1: Tommy

0:12:30.3 S1: will

0:12:30.7 S1: fall."

0:12:31.1 S1: But

0:12:31.4 S1: the

0:12:31.7 S1: lumberjack

0:12:32.6 S1: is

0:12:32.8 S1: a

0:12:32.9 S1: very

0:12:33.4 S1: stubborn

0:12:33.9 S1: person

0:12:34.3 S1: and

0:12:34.5 S1: he

0:12:34.6 S1: says,

0:12:34.9 S1: "Well,

0:12:35.2 S1: I

0:12:35.3 S1: will

0:12:35.5 S1: do

0:12:35.7 S1: it

0:12:35.8 S1: anyway."

0:12:36.2 S1: So

0:12:36.4 S1: he

0:12:36.5 S1: starts

0:12:36.9 S1: to

0:12:37.0 S1: cut

0:12:37.2 S1: the

0:12:37.4 S1: tree,

0:12:37.7 S1: he

0:12:37.9 S1: starts

0:12:38.2 S1: to

0:12:38.5 S1: use

0:12:40.4 S1: his

0:12:42.3 S1: axe,

0:12:43.7 S1: and

0:12:45.2 S1: the

0:12:45.4 S1: tree

0:12:45.8 S1: is

0:12:46.1 S1: half

0:12:46.5 S1: taken

0:12:47.0 S1: and

0:12:47.3 S1: Tommy

0:12:47.8 S1: says,

0:12:48.3 S1: "Oh,

0:12:48.5 S1: no

0:12:48.7 S1: it's

0:12:49.1 S1: shaking,

0:12:49.7 S1: I

0:12:49.8 S1: don't

0:12:50.0 S1: know

0:12:50.1 S1: if

0:12:50.3 S1: I

0:12:50.4 S1: can

0:12:50.6 S1: do

0:12:50.8 S1: it."

0:12:51.4 S1: But

0:12:51.5 S1: the

0:12:51.7 S1: lumber

0:12:52.3 S1: says "

0:12:52.7 S1: Yeah,

0:12:53.1 S1: hold

0:12:53.6 S1: on."

0:12:53.8 S1: And

0:12:54.1 S1: the

0:12:54.5 S1: tree

0:12:54.9 S1: falls

0:12:55.4 S1: down

0:12:55.8 S1: with

0:12:56.3 S1: Tommy

0:12:56.8 S1: on

0:12:57.0 S1: the

0:12:57.1 S1: top.

0:13:00.5 S1: Oh,

0:12:57.4 S1: so

0:12:57.7 S1: the

0:12:58.0 S1: tree

0:12:58.4 S1: is

0:12:58.7 S1: falling,

0:12:59.4 S1: falling,

0:13:00.1 S1: it's

0:13:00.5 S1: a

0:13:00.7 S1: really

0:13:01.3 S1: big

0:13:01.6 S1: tree.

0:13:02.0 S1: The

0:13:02.4 S1: lumberjack

0:13:03.3 S1: says,

0:13:03.7 S1: "Everybody

0:13:04.6 S1: get

0:13:04.9 S1: out

0:13:05.3 S1: of

0:13:05.5 S1: the

0:13:05.9 S1: way."

0:13:06.2 S1: It's

0:13:06.6 S1: falling

0:13:07.3 S1: but

0:13:07.7 S1: luckily

0:13:08.3 S1: they

0:13:08.4 S1: are

0:13:08.7 S1: super

0:13:09.0 S1: close

0:13:09.3 S1: to

0:13:09.4 S1: the

0:13:09.6 S1: river,

0:13:09.8 S1: Tommy

0:13:10.1 S1: didn't

0:13:10.4 S1: move

0:13:10.6 S1: that

0:13:10.8 S1: far

0:13:11.0 S1: away

0:13:11.2 S1: from

0:13:11.3 S1: the

0:13:11.5 S1: river.

0:13:12.0 S1: So

0:13:12.3 S1: he

0:13:12.4 S1: is

0:13:12.7 S1: able

0:13:13.0 S1: to...

0:13:13.2 S1: At

0:13:13.3 S1: the

0:13:13.5 S1: last

0:13:13.8 S1: minute

0:13:14.3 S1: he

0:13:14.4 S1: jumps

0:13:14.8 S1: off

0:13:15.1 S1: the

0:13:15.4 S1: tree,

0:13:15.7 S1: and

0:13:16.0 S1: he

0:13:16.2 S1: lands

0:13:16.5 S1: in

0:13:16.7 S1: the

0:13:16.9 S1: river,

0:13:18.1 S1: and

0:13:18.3 S1: the

0:13:18.5 S1: current

0:13:18.8 S1: isn't

0:13:19.1 S1: too

0:13:19.4 S1: strong

0:13:19.8 S1: this

0:13:20.1 S1: time

0:13:20.4 S1: so

0:13:20.5 S1: he

0:13:20.7 S1: just

0:13:21.0 S1: splash

0:13:21.4 S1: lands

0:13:21.7 S1: in

0:13:22.1 S1: the

0:13:22.2 S1: water

0:13:23.6 S1: and

0:13:23.7 S1: is

0:13:23.9 S1: swimming

0:13:24.5 S1: and

0:13:24.7 S1: all

0:13:24.8 S1: the

0:13:24.9 S1: people

0:13:25.3 S1: run

0:13:25.6 S1: off

0:13:25.9 S1: and

0:13:26.2 S1: they're

0:13:26.8 S1: swimming

0:13:27.1 S1: to

0:13:27.3 S1: him

0:13:27.5 S1: and

0:13:27.8 S1: they

0:13:28.2 S1: manage

0:13:28.7 S1: to

0:13:29.0 S1: get

0:13:29.2 S1: him

0:13:29.5 S1: out

0:13:29.8 S1: and

0:13:30.1 S1: get

0:13:30.4 S1: him

0:13:30.7 S1: on

0:13:30.9 S1: the

0:13:31.2 S1: dry

0:13:31.5 S1: land.

0:13:31.9 S1: So

0:13:32.1 S1: finally

0:13:32.7 S1: Tommy

0:13:33.1 S1: was

0:13:33.3 S1: rescued

0:13:34.0 S1: and

0:13:34.1 S1: the

0:13:34.3 S1: bear

0:13:34.6 S1: is

0:13:34.7 S1: also

0:13:35.0 S1: okay

0:13:35.4 S1: so

0:13:35.7 S1: they

0:13:36.0 S1: come

0:13:36.4 S1: back

0:13:36.8 S1: home

0:13:37.1 S1: pretty

0:13:37.4 S1: happy

0:13:38.2 S1: but

0:13:38.4 S1: in

0:13:39.1 S1: the

0:13:39.2 S1: end,

0:13:39.5 S1: the

0:13:39.7 S1: lumberjack

0:13:40.4 S1: still

0:13:40.7 S1: lost

0:13:41.4 S1: his

0:13:41.8 S1: squirrel.

0:13:42.9 S1: So

0:13:43.2 S1: he

0:13:43.6 S1: asks

0:13:44.1 S1: Tommy,

0:13:44.8 S1: "Well

0:13:45.4 S1: now

0:13:45.8 S1: you

0:13:46.3 S1: help

0:13:46.6 S1: me

0:13:47.5 S1: in

0:13:49.0 S1: my...

0:13:50.1 S1: In

0:13:50.3 S1: the

0:13:50.5 S1: garage,

0:13:51.1 S1: so

0:13:51.3 S1: we

0:13:51.4 S1: will

0:13:51.6 S1: work

0:13:52.1 S1: together

0:13:52.4 S1: because

0:13:52.9 S1: my

0:13:53.2 S1: daughter

0:13:53.7 S1: will

0:13:53.9 S1: have

0:13:54.1 S1: her

0:13:54.4 S1: birthday

0:13:55.0 S1: the

0:13:55.3 S1: next

0:13:55.6 S1: week

0:13:55.9 S1: and

0:13:56.1 S1: we

0:13:56.3 S1: need

0:13:56.6 S1: to

0:13:56.8 S1: have

0:13:57.4 S1: a

0:13:57.7 S1: bunch

0:13:58.2 S1: of

0:13:58.4 S1: wooden

0:13:58.8 S1: squirrels

0:13:59.2 S1: now."

0:14:00.4 S1: So,

0:14:00.5 S1: they

0:14:01.1 S1: agree,

0:14:01.3 S1: Tommy

0:14:01.6 S1: needs

0:14:01.8 S1: to

0:14:01.9 S1: help

0:14:02.1 S1: him

0:14:02.2 S1: make

0:14:02.4 S1: a

0:14:02.5 S1: new

0:14:02.7 S1: squirrel

0:14:03.0 S1: because

0:14:03.3 S1: he

0:14:03.4 S1: stole

0:14:03.7 S1: the

0:14:04.0 S1: old

0:14:04.1 S1: squirrel.

0:14:05.7 S1: So

0:14:05.9 S1: Tommy

0:14:06.1 S1: and

0:14:06.3 S1: the

0:14:06.4 S1: lumberjack,

0:14:06.9 S1: they

0:14:07.1 S1: start

0:14:07.4 S1: working

0:14:07.7 S1: on

0:14:07.9 S1: it

0:14:08.0 S1: and

0:14:08.3 S1: the

0:14:08.5 S1: lumberjack

0:14:09.1 S1: is

0:14:09.2 S1: showing

0:14:09.6 S1: Tommy

0:14:09.9 S1: all

0:14:10.0 S1: of

0:14:10.1 S1: his

0:14:10.3 S1: special

0:14:10.7 S1: wood

0:14:11.0 S1: making

0:14:11.4 S1: skills,

0:14:11.8 S1: he

0:14:12.0 S1: starts

0:14:12.4 S1: teaching

0:14:12.9 S1: Tommy

0:14:13.2 S1: about

0:14:13.4 S1: the

0:14:13.5 S1: different

0:14:13.7 S1: kinds

0:14:14.0 S1: of

0:14:14.1 S1: wood

0:14:14.4 S1: which

0:14:14.6 S1: Tommy

0:14:14.9 S1: really

0:14:15.1 S1: likes

0:14:15.4 S1: 'cause

0:14:15.6 S1: Tommy

0:14:15.8 S1: is

0:14:15.9 S1: in

0:14:16.0 S1: the

0:14:16.2 S1: woods

0:14:16.4 S1: all

0:14:16.5 S1: the

0:14:16.6 S1: time

0:14:16.9 S1: so

0:14:17.2 S1: all

0:14:17.2 S1: this

0:14:17.8 S1: is

0:14:18.0 S1: super

0:14:18.3 S1: interesting

0:14:18.8 S1: to

0:14:18.9 S1: him,

0:14:19.1 S1: he

0:14:19.2 S1: is

0:14:19.3 S1: like "

0:14:19.5 S1: Yeah

0:14:20.0 S1: like

0:14:20.0 S1: I

0:14:20.1 S1: actually

0:14:20.5 S1: really

0:14:20.7 S1: find

0:14:20.9 S1: this

0:14:21.0 S1: very

0:14:21.3 S1: interesting,

0:14:21.9 S1: Mr.

0:14:22.1 S1: Lumberjack,

0:14:22.9 S1: do

0:14:23.1 S1: you

0:14:23.3 S1: think

0:14:23.7 S1: I

0:14:23.8 S1: could

0:14:24.0 S1: continue

0:14:24.5 S1: to

0:14:24.6 S1: be

0:14:24.7 S1: your

0:14:24.9 S1: apprentice

0:14:25.5 S1: and

0:14:26.1 S1: keep

0:14:26.5 S1: learning

0:14:26.8 S1: about

0:14:27.0 S1: how

0:14:27.1 S1: to

0:14:27.4 S1: cut

0:14:27.7 S1: down

0:14:28.2 S1: wood

0:14:28.6 S1: and

0:14:28.9 S1: make

0:14:29.3 S1: wood

0:14:29.7 S1: things?"

0:14:30.3 S1: And

0:14:30.6 S1: this

0:14:31.0 S1: is

0:14:31.2 S1: how

0:14:31.5 S1: a

0:14:31.7 S1: seven-

0:14:32.1 S1: year-

0:14:32.3 S1: old

0:14:32.7 S1: Tommy

0:14:33.2 S1: decided

0:14:33.7 S1: to

0:14:33.9 S1: become

0:14:34.4 S1: a

0:14:34.6 S1: ranger

0:14:35.1 S1: in

0:14:35.3 S1: the

0:14:35.6 S1: national

0:14:36.2 S1: park

0:14:36.5 S1: later

0:14:36.9 S1: on

0:14:37.1 S1: in

0:14:37.3 S1: his

0:14:37.5 S1: life.

0:14:38.0 S1: So

0:14:38.2 S1: he

0:14:38.4 S1: spends

0:14:38.7 S1: his

0:14:38.9 S1: lot

0:14:39.7 S1: of

0:14:40.2 S1: time

0:14:41.0 S1: with

0:14:41.3 S1: lumberjack,

0:14:43.1 S1: learning

0:14:43.4 S1: about

0:14:43.9 S1: woods

0:14:44.8 S1: and

0:14:45.7 S1: crafting

0:14:46.3 S1: and

0:14:46.7 S1: sculpting

0:14:48.0 S1: different

0:14:49.7 S1: sculptures,

0:14:51.0 S1: and

0:14:51.3 S1: in

0:14:51.5 S1: the

0:14:51.6 S1: end

0:14:51.8 S1: when

0:14:52.1 S1: he

0:14:52.2 S1: was

0:14:52.4 S1: about

0:14:52.9 S1: 20

0:14:53.6 S1: something,

0:14:55.3 S1: he

0:14:55.4 S1: became

0:14:55.8 S1: a

0:14:55.9 S1: ranger

0:14:56.4 S1: in

0:14:56.5 S1: the

0:14:57.1 S1: Yes.
