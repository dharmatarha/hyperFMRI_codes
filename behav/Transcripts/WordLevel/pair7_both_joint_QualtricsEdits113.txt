0:00:00.7 S1: Okay,

0:00:01.3 S1: so

0:00:01.4 S1: a

0:00:01.4 S1: group

0:00:01.8 S1: of

0:00:01.9 S1: students

0:00:04.5 S1: see

0:00:05.7 S1: that

0:00:05.9 S1: aliens

0:00:06.4 S1: have

0:00:06.9 S1: just

0:00:07.5 S1: landed,

0:00:08.1 S1: and

0:00:08.4 S1: they

0:00:08.8 S1: get

0:00:09.0 S1: on

0:00:09.1 S1: their

0:00:09.3 S1: bikes

0:00:10.8 S1: and

0:00:10.9 S1: they're

0:00:11.1 S1: riding

0:00:11.5 S1: out.

0:00:12.5 S1: I

0:00:12.6 S1: guess

0:00:12.8 S1: these

0:00:13.0 S1: kids

0:00:13.2 S1: are

0:00:13.3 S1: like

0:00:13.5 S1: 14,

0:00:14.5 S1: 15.

0:00:15.2 S1: They're

0:00:15.4 S1: riding

0:00:15.7 S1: out

0:00:15.8 S1: and

0:00:15.9 S1: they

0:00:16.6 S1: show

0:00:16.8 S1: up

0:00:18.2 S1: and

0:00:18.3 S1: they

0:00:18.5 S1: see

0:00:18.7 S1: where

0:00:18.8 S1: the

0:00:19.0 S1: spaceship

0:00:19.4 S1: just

0:00:19.6 S1: landed.

0:00:20.6 S1: They're

0:00:20.9 S1: really

0:00:21.2 S1: excited,

0:00:21.6 S1: but

0:00:21.7 S1: they're

0:00:21.9 S1: really

0:00:22.1 S1: nervous

0:00:22.4 S1: and

0:00:22.6 S1: they're

0:00:22.8 S1: kind

0:00:23.2 S1: of

0:00:23.4 S1: hiding

0:00:23.9 S1: behind

0:00:24.0 S1: some

0:00:24.4 S1: bushes.

0:00:25.0 S1: And

0:00:25.6 S1: suddenly

0:00:25.9 S1: a

0:00:26.1 S1: door

0:00:26.4 S1: opens.

0:00:31.2 S2: And

0:00:31.6 S2: outside

0:00:32.3 S2: the

0:00:32.7 S2: door

0:00:33.0 S2: is

0:00:35.3 S2: Michael

0:00:35.6 S2: Jackson

0:00:37.4 S2: and

0:00:38.1 S2: like

0:00:38.4 S2: what?

0:00:38.8 S2: So

0:00:39.0 S2: one

0:00:39.5 S2: of

0:00:39.7 S2: the

0:00:40.0 S2: student's

0:00:40.6 S2: a

0:00:40.7 S2: huge

0:00:41.0 S2: Michael

0:00:42.3 S2: Jackson

0:00:43.5 S2: fan,

0:00:43.9 S2: so

0:00:44.2 S2: he

0:00:44.3 S2: just

0:00:44.5 S2: is

0:00:45.0 S2: overcome

0:00:46.2 S2: by

0:00:46.4 S2: joy,

0:00:46.9 S2: and

0:00:47.2 S2: breaks

0:00:47.6 S2: cover

0:00:47.9 S2: and

0:00:48.1 S2: starts

0:00:48.5 S2: running

0:00:48.9 S2: towards

0:00:49.1 S2: Michael

0:00:49.5 S2: Jackson.

0:00:50.3 S2: But

0:00:50.7 S2: as

0:00:51.0 S2: soon

0:00:51.4 S2: as

0:00:51.7 S2: he

0:00:52.0 S2: gets

0:00:52.5 S2: close,

0:00:53.1 S2: the

0:00:53.5 S2: figure

0:00:54.1 S2: that

0:00:54.3 S2: he

0:00:54.3 S2: once

0:00:54.3 S2: thought

0:00:54.4 S2: was

0:00:54.5 S2: Michael

0:00:56.5 S2: Jackson,

0:00:58.2 S2: suddenly

0:00:58.7 S2: shifts

0:00:59.1 S2: form

0:00:59.3 S2: and

0:00:59.5 S2: turns

0:00:59.8 S2: into...

0:01:00.1 S1: It

0:01:00.2 S1: turns

0:01:00.5 S1: into

0:01:00.8 S1: a

0:01:01.5 S1: big

0:01:03.0 S1: hamburger,

0:01:04.6 S1: which

0:01:04.7 S1: is

0:01:05.0 S1: really

0:01:05.4 S1: surprising

0:01:06.2 S1: because

0:01:07.9 S1: the

0:01:08.0 S1: kids

0:01:08.2 S1: have

0:01:08.6 S1: seen

0:01:09.0 S1: spaceships

0:01:09.3 S1: before

0:01:09.5 S1: but

0:01:09.6 S1: never

0:01:09.9 S1: like

0:01:10.0 S1: this

0:01:10.3 S1: one.

0:01:10.4 S1: This

0:01:10.5 S1: is

0:01:10.6 S1: the

0:01:10.8 S1: biggest

0:01:11.1 S1: hamburger

0:01:11.6 S1: they've

0:01:11.8 S1: ever

0:01:12.1 S1: seen

0:01:13.8 S1: and

0:01:13.9 S1: they

0:01:14.1 S1: look

0:01:14.2 S1: at

0:01:14.3 S1: Michael

0:01:14.7 S1: Jackson,

0:01:15.1 S1: and

0:01:15.2 S1: they

0:01:15.3 S1: say

0:01:15.4 S1: "What's

0:01:15.6 S1: going

0:01:15.8 S1: on

0:01:16.0 S1: with

0:01:16.1 S1: your

0:01:16.3 S1: spaceship?"

0:01:18.4 S1: And

0:01:18.5 S1: he

0:01:18.7 S1: goes,

0:01:18.8 S1: "Well,

0:01:19.1 S1: kids,

0:01:19.6 S1: it's

0:01:20.2 S1: more

0:01:20.8 S1: than

0:01:21.3 S1: a

0:01:21.5 S1: spaceship,

0:01:23.7 S1: this

0:01:24.8 S1: baby,

0:01:25.9 S1: it

0:01:26.3 S1: can

0:01:26.5 S1: take

0:01:26.9 S1: anywhere

0:01:27.5 S1: you

0:01:27.7 S1: want

0:01:27.8 S1: to

0:01:27.9 S1: go."

0:01:28.3 S2: It's

0:01:29.9 S2: my

0:01:30.8 S2: new

0:01:31.8 S2: portable

0:01:33.4 S2: Neverland

0:01:34.3 S2: Ranch

0:01:34.8 S2: and

0:01:35.2 S2: then

0:01:35.6 S2: the

0:01:36.0 S2: kid's

0:01:36.5 S2: confused.

0:01:37.2 S2: And

0:01:38.0 S2: he's

0:01:38.8 S2: like,

0:01:39.0 S2: "Yeah,

0:01:39.2 S2: I

0:01:39.3 S2: didn't

0:01:39.8 S2: really

0:01:40.0 S2: die.

0:01:40.3 S2: I

0:01:40.4 S2: just

0:01:40.7 S2: got

0:01:40.9 S2: tired

0:01:41.3 S2: of

0:01:41.4 S2: being

0:01:41.8 S2: in

0:01:41.9 S2: the

0:01:42.1 S2: press

0:01:42.3 S2: all

0:01:42.5 S2: the

0:01:42.6 S2: time,

0:01:43.1 S2: so

0:01:44.2 S2: I

0:01:44.3 S2: built

0:01:44.6 S2: this

0:01:44.9 S2: spaceship

0:01:45.4 S2: with

0:01:45.6 S2: my

0:01:45.8 S2: UFO

0:01:46.0 S2: buddies,

0:01:46.4 S2: those

0:01:46.7 S2: three

0:01:46.9 S2: guys

0:01:47.2 S2: back

0:01:47.4 S2: there

0:01:47.7 S2: and

0:01:47.9 S2: just

0:01:48.2 S2: been

0:01:48.4 S2: travelling

0:01:48.9 S2: around

0:01:49.1 S2: the

0:01:49.2 S2: galaxy.

0:01:50.7 S2: Looking

0:01:52.4 S2: to

0:01:53.0 S2: find

0:01:54.1 S2: myself

0:01:55.4 S2: and

0:01:56.7 S2: I

0:01:56.9 S2: think

0:01:57.2 S2: I

0:01:57.3 S2: have."

0:02:00.1 S1: And

0:02:00.2 S1: the

0:02:00.3 S1: kids

0:02:00.6 S1: go,

0:02:00.7 S1: "That's

0:02:00.9 S1: great,

0:02:01.2 S1: Michael.

0:02:03.2 S1: I'm

0:02:03.4 S1: really

0:02:03.6 S1: happy

0:02:04.0 S1: for

0:02:04.2 S1: you.

0:02:05.7 S1: But

0:02:07.6 S1: what

0:02:07.8 S1: are

0:02:07.9 S1: your

0:02:08.1 S1: plans

0:02:08.4 S1: for

0:02:08.5 S1: the

0:02:08.6 S1: future?"

0:02:10.9 S1: And

0:02:11.0 S1: he

0:02:11.2 S1: says,

0:02:11.5 S1: "Well,

0:02:11.7 S1: I

0:02:11.8 S1: think

0:02:12.0 S1: I'm

0:02:12.2 S1: gonna

0:02:12.4 S1: go

0:02:12.5 S1: back

0:02:12.6 S1: to

0:02:12.7 S1: making

0:02:13.1 S1: music.

0:02:13.5 S1: I'm

0:02:13.6 S1: back

0:02:13.9 S1: to

0:02:14.0 S1: Earth

0:02:15.5 S1: and

0:02:18.2 S1: I

0:02:18.6 S1: have

0:02:18.8 S1: a

0:02:18.9 S1: couple

0:02:19.1 S1: a

0:02:19.2 S1: new

0:02:19.3 S1: dance

0:02:19.6 S1: moves

0:02:19.9 S1: to

0:02:20.1 S1: show

0:02:20.4 S1: you."

0:02:22.7 S1: The

0:02:22.9 S1: kid

0:02:23.1 S1: say,

0:02:23.2 S1: "Okay.

0:02:23.6 S1: Well,

0:02:23.8 S1: why

0:02:24.0 S1: don't

0:02:24.4 S1: you

0:02:24.6 S1: show

0:02:24.8 S1: us

0:02:25.0 S1: some

0:02:25.2 S1: of

0:02:25.3 S1: your

0:02:25.4 S1: dance

0:02:25.7 S1: moves?"

0:02:26.2 S1: So

0:02:26.4 S1: Michael

0:02:26.7 S1: Jackson

0:02:27.1 S1: says,

0:02:27.2 S1: "Okay

0:02:27.5 S1: but

0:02:27.6 S1: you

0:02:27.8 S1: gotta

0:02:29.4 S1: backup."

0:02:31.0 S2: So

0:02:31.2 S2: then

0:02:31.2 S2: Michael

0:02:31.2 S2: Jackson

0:02:31.2 S2: just

0:02:31.2 S2: starts

0:02:31.2 S2: dabbing

0:02:31.2 S2: not

0:02:31.2 S2: realizing

0:02:31.2 S2: that

0:02:31.2 S2: that

0:02:31.5 S2: was

0:02:32.9 S2: a

0:02:33.7 S2: move

0:02:35.5 S2: three

0:02:37.3 S2: years

0:02:37.5 S2: ago.

0:02:39.3 S2: And

0:02:40.3 S2: all

0:02:40.5 S2: the

0:02:40.6 S2: kids

0:02:41.1 S2: just

0:02:41.2 S2: looked

0:02:41.3 S2: disappointed

0:02:41.4 S2: and

0:02:42.4 S2: said,

0:02:43.1 S2: "Michael,

0:02:44.3 S2: you've

0:02:45.3 S2: lost

0:02:46.1 S2: us."

0:02:46.4 S2: Michael

0:02:46.9 S2: turns

0:02:47.5 S2: around

0:02:48.3 S2: but

0:02:48.7 S2: turns

0:02:49.4 S2: back

0:02:49.9 S2: and

0:02:50.3 S2: goes,

0:02:50.9 S2: "Psych,

0:02:51.5 S2: that

0:02:52.1 S2: wasn't

0:02:52.7 S2: my

0:02:52.8 S2: real

0:02:53.1 S2: dance

0:02:53.6 S2: move.

0:02:54.0 S2: Even

0:02:54.5 S2: though

0:02:55.1 S2: Billy

0:02:55.7 S2: Jean

0:02:56.0 S2: and

0:02:56.2 S2: I

0:02:56.3 S2: dab

0:02:56.9 S2: but

0:02:57.5 S2: my

0:02:57.9 S2: real

0:02:58.6 S2: dance

0:02:59.5 S2: move

0:03:00.2 S2: is... "

0:02:56.0 S1: And

0:03:01.0 S1: so

0:03:01.3 S1: he

0:03:02.3 S1: does

0:03:02.4 S1: a

0:03:02.6 S1: quick

0:03:02.9 S1: headstand,

0:03:03.8 S1: a

0:03:03.9 S1: handstand

0:03:05.6 S1: and

0:03:05.8 S1: he

0:03:06.0 S1: starts

0:03:06.2 S1: doing

0:03:06.5 S1: the

0:03:06.6 S1: moonwalk

0:03:07.1 S1: on

0:03:07.2 S1: his

0:03:07.4 S1: hands.

0:03:10.1 S1: And

0:03:10.2 S1: the

0:03:10.4 S1: kids

0:03:10.6 S1: are

0:03:10.8 S1: going,

0:03:12.2 S1: "Alright

0:03:12.5 S1: that's

0:03:12.8 S1: pretty

0:03:13.1 S1: cool."

0:03:14.9 S1: And

0:03:15.0 S1: then

0:03:15.2 S1: Michael

0:03:15.5 S1: Jackson

0:03:16.0 S1: goes,

0:03:16.4 S1: "Yeah,

0:03:16.7 S1: but

0:03:16.8 S1: check

0:03:17.0 S1: this

0:03:17.2 S1: out,"

0:03:17.5 S1: and

0:03:18.2 S1: he

0:03:18.5 S1: pulls

0:03:18.7 S1: out

0:03:18.9 S1: a

0:03:19.1 S1: fiddle

0:03:21.4 S1: and

0:03:21.6 S1: he

0:03:21.7 S1: starts

0:03:22.9 S1: playing

0:03:24.2 S1: The

0:03:24.4 S1: Devil

0:03:24.4 S1: Went

0:03:24.4 S1: Down

0:03:24.4 S1: to

0:03:24.4 S1: Georgia

0:03:24.7 S1: on

0:03:24.9 S1: the

0:03:25.0 S1: fiddle.

0:03:27.0 S1: And

0:03:27.1 S1: he

0:03:27.3 S1: says,

0:03:27.5 S1: "Wait

0:03:27.7 S1: till

0:03:27.8 S1: you

0:03:28.0 S1: see

0:03:28.1 S1: this."

0:03:30.8 S2: And

0:03:31.0 S2: almost

0:03:31.3 S2: on

0:03:31.4 S2: cue,

0:03:31.4 S2: the

0:03:31.5 S2: fiddle

0:03:31.5 S2: seems

0:03:31.6 S2: to

0:03:31.7 S2: have

0:03:32.6 S2: been

0:03:33.5 S2: a

0:03:33.8 S2: signal

0:03:35.1 S2: for

0:03:35.8 S2: his

0:03:36.5 S2: pet

0:03:37.0 S2: to

0:03:37.2 S2: come

0:03:37.3 S2: out

0:03:37.5 S2: of

0:03:37.5 S2: the

0:03:38.0 S2: spaceship

0:03:39.2 S2: and

0:03:40.0 S2: the

0:03:40.7 S2: pet,

0:03:41.4 S2: it

0:03:42.0 S2: looks

0:03:42.9 S2: almost

0:03:43.2 S2: like

0:03:43.3 S2: a

0:03:43.5 S2: tiny

0:03:44.0 S2: dragon.

0:03:45.3 S2: It

0:03:45.5 S2: resembles

0:03:47.4 S2: that

0:03:47.8 S2: dragon

0:03:48.7 S2: thing

0:03:49.5 S2: from

0:03:50.0 S2: power

0:03:50.3 S2: Raid

0:03:50.4 S2: Heroes.

0:03:50.7 S2: This

0:03:50.9 S2: one,

0:03:51.0 S2: the

0:03:51.1 S2: green

0:03:51.5 S2: one

0:03:52.1 S2: plays

0:03:52.5 S2: his

0:03:52.6 S2: little

0:03:53.0 S2: fiddle

0:03:53.8 S2: instrument,

0:03:54.9 S2: except

0:03:55.7 S2: less

0:03:56.2 S2: robotic

0:03:57.1 S2: and

0:03:57.5 S2: more

0:03:58.0 S2: dragon-

0:03:58.7 S2: y

0:03:59.0 S2: like.

0:03:59.5 S2: He

0:03:59.8 S2: goes,

0:04:00.3 S2: "This

0:04:00.9 S2: is

0:04:01.1 S2: my

0:04:01.3 S2: dragon

0:04:01.6 S2: named... "

0:03:57.6 S1: Right,

0:04:02.0 S1: "This

0:04:02.2 S1: is

0:04:02.4 S1: my

0:04:02.5 S1: dragon

0:04:02.8 S1: named

0:04:03.0 S1: Wilbur.

0:04:03.3 S1: So

0:04:03.4 S1: Wilbur

0:04:05.2 S1: plays

0:04:06.6 S1: his

0:04:06.7 S1: own

0:04:07.0 S1: fiddle.

0:04:07.2 S1: It's

0:04:07.4 S1: a

0:04:07.4 S1: slightly

0:04:08.0 S1: smaller

0:04:08.4 S1: fiddle."

0:04:10.8 S1: And

0:04:11.1 S1: sure

0:04:11.3 S1: enough

0:04:11.8 S1: his

0:04:12.1 S1: pet

0:04:13.3 S1: comes

0:04:13.6 S1: out

0:04:14.0 S1: of

0:04:14.2 S1: the

0:04:14.4 S1: spaceship

0:04:15.2 S1: and

0:04:15.3 S1: it's

0:04:17.3 S1: a

0:04:17.5 S1: green

0:04:19.1 S1: sort

0:04:19.8 S1: of

0:04:20.2 S1: snake-

0:04:20.9 S1: like

0:04:21.4 S1: creature

0:04:24.1 S1: and

0:04:24.3 S1: he

0:04:24.4 S1: plays

0:04:24.7 S1: the

0:04:24.9 S1: fiddle

0:04:26.9 S1: with

0:04:27.0 S1: his

0:04:27.2 S1: long

0:04:27.7 S1: tongue.

0:04:30.7 S2: And

0:04:30.9 S2: then

0:04:32.0 S2: all

0:04:32.3 S2: of

0:04:32.3 S2: a

0:04:32.3 S2: sudden,

0:04:34.1 S2: it's

0:04:34.1 S2: overcome

0:04:34.1 S2: by

0:04:34.3 S2: darkness

0:04:35.7 S2: and

0:04:35.9 S2: it

0:04:36.0 S2: turns

0:04:36.2 S2: out

0:04:36.3 S2: that

0:04:36.4 S2: the

0:04:36.4 S2: snake's

0:04:36.4 S2: head

0:04:36.4 S2: is

0:04:36.5 S2: actually

0:04:36.7 S2: the

0:04:36.7 S2: great

0:04:36.8 S2: overlord

0:04:36.9 S2: Cthulhu.

0:04:37.0 S2: Which

0:04:37.1 S2: is

0:04:37.3 S2: quite

0:04:37.9 S2: unfortunate

0:04:39.1 S2: for

0:04:39.5 S2: the

0:04:40.0 S2: kids

0:04:40.5 S2: as

0:04:40.8 S2: Cthulhu

0:04:41.6 S2: feeds

0:04:42.2 S2: off

0:04:42.6 S2: the

0:04:43.0 S2: destruction

0:04:44.2 S2: of

0:04:44.5 S2: planets,

0:04:45.3 S2: so

0:04:45.6 S2: everyone's

0:04:46.4 S2: a

0:04:46.5 S2: little

0:04:47.0 S2: worried

0:04:47.6 S2: now.

0:04:47.9 S2: Cthulhu

0:04:48.6 S2: comes

0:04:49.2 S2: moaning,

0:04:49.9 S2: groaning,

0:04:50.7 S2: his

0:04:51.0 S2: usual

0:04:51.6 S2: destructiveness.

0:04:53.0 S2: But

0:04:53.4 S2: he

0:04:53.7 S2: says,

0:04:54.1 S2: "Don't

0:04:54.6 S2: worry.

0:04:55.2 S2: Don't

0:04:55.7 S2: worry

0:04:56.3 S2: I'm

0:04:56.6 S2: only

0:04:57.0 S2: here

0:04:57.4 S2: to... "

0:05:00.0 S1: "Get

0:05:00.1 S1: some

0:05:00.3 S1: ice

0:05:00.5 S1: cream."

0:05:00.7 S1: He

0:05:00.9 S1: was

0:05:01.0 S1: actually

0:05:01.7 S1: a...

0:05:02.2 S1: He

0:05:02.5 S1: loves

0:05:03.5 S1: Ben

0:05:04.2 S1: and

0:05:04.8 S1: Jerry's.

0:05:06.1 S1: So

0:05:06.6 S1: he

0:05:07.1 S1: just

0:05:07.9 S1: says

0:05:08.7 S1: hello,

0:05:09.6 S1: introduces

0:05:10.1 S1: himself

0:05:12.3 S1: and

0:05:12.4 S1: then

0:05:12.6 S1: excuses

0:05:13.1 S1: himself

0:05:14.4 S1: and

0:05:15.1 S1: heads

0:05:15.4 S1: over

0:05:15.7 S1: to

0:05:15.9 S1: Vermont,

0:05:17.1 S1: to

0:05:17.3 S1: the

0:05:17.5 S1: Ben

0:05:18.2 S1: and

0:05:19.0 S1: Jerry's

0:05:20.6 S1: factory.

0:05:21.9 S1: And

0:05:22.1 S1: really

0:05:22.4 S1: just

0:05:22.7 S1: has

0:05:23.8 S1: two

0:05:24.0 S1: scoops

0:05:24.2 S1: of

0:05:24.3 S1: ice

0:05:24.5 S1: cream

0:05:25.1 S1: and

0:05:25.3 S1: when

0:05:25.5 S1: he's

0:05:25.7 S1: there,

0:05:31.8 S1: he's

0:05:33.8 S1: talking

0:05:34.3 S1: to

0:05:34.4 S1: the

0:05:34.6 S1: ice

0:05:34.7 S1: cream

0:05:34.9 S1: salesman

0:05:35.1 S1: and

0:05:35.2 S1: he

0:05:35.3 S1: says...

0:05:35.5 S2: He

0:05:35.5 S2: says,

0:05:35.7 S2: "Cthulhu,

0:05:35.9 S2: you

0:05:36.0 S2: look

0:05:36.1 S2: really

0:05:36.3 S2: tense."

0:05:36.5 S2: He

0:05:36.5 S2: like,

0:05:36.7 S2: "My

0:05:36.7 S2: partner's

0:05:37.0 S2: actually

0:05:37.2 S2: running

0:05:37.5 S2: a

0:05:37.6 S2: yoga

0:05:37.9 S2: retreat

0:05:38.4 S2: this

0:05:38.7 S2: weekend,

0:05:39.1 S2: by

0:05:39.5 S2: Sunapee,

0:05:40.5 S2: you

0:05:41.0 S2: should

0:05:41.8 S2: come

0:05:42.3 S2: check

0:05:42.5 S2: it

0:05:42.6 S2: out.

0:05:42.8 S2: We'll

0:05:43.1 S2: get

0:05:43.2 S2: you

0:05:43.3 S2: all

0:05:43.5 S2: loosened

0:05:43.7 S2: up,

0:05:44.4 S2: and

0:05:45.9 S2: destress

0:05:45.9 S2: from

0:05:45.9 S2: all

0:05:45.9 S2: this

0:05:45.9 S2: destruction

0:05:45.9 S2: you

0:05:46.0 S2: do,

0:05:46.2 S2: all

0:05:46.4 S2: these

0:05:46.7 S2: worlds

0:05:47.1 S2: you

0:05:47.4 S2: destroy.

0:05:47.8 S2: It'll

0:05:48.1 S2: be

0:05:48.3 S2: really

0:05:48.6 S2: good."

0:05:48.9 S2: And

0:05:49.3 S2: Cthulhu

0:05:50.0 S2: says,

0:05:50.4 S2: "It's

0:05:50.9 S2: worth

0:05:51.4 S2: a

0:05:51.5 S2: shot.

0:05:51.8 S2: I

0:05:52.0 S2: don't

0:05:52.3 S2: got

0:05:52.6 S2: anything

0:05:53.2 S2: to

0:05:53.4 S2: do

0:05:53.5 S2: until

0:05:53.9 S2: Monday,

0:05:54.4 S2: so

0:05:54.5 S2: yeah,

0:05:54.9 S2: let's

0:05:55.2 S2: do

0:05:55.4 S2: it."

0:05:55.6 S2: The

0:05:55.9 S2: kids

0:05:56.2 S2: are

0:05:56.4 S2: just

0:05:56.7 S2: like,

0:05:57.1 S2: "I

0:05:57.2 S2: have

0:05:57.5 S2: no

0:05:57.7 S2: idea

0:05:57.9 S2: what's

0:05:58.1 S2: going

0:05:58.8 S2: on."

0:06:00.8 S1: So

0:06:00.2 S1: Cthulhu

0:06:01.5 S1: shows

0:06:02.5 S1: up

0:06:02.9 S1: to

0:06:03.3 S1: the

0:06:03.4 S1: class

0:06:06.3 S1: and

0:06:06.4 S1: he's

0:06:06.6 S1: feeling

0:06:06.9 S1: a

0:06:07.0 S1: little

0:06:07.2 S1: out

0:06:07.3 S1: of

0:06:07.4 S1: place.

0:06:07.7 S1: He's

0:06:07.9 S1: never

0:06:08.1 S1: really

0:06:08.3 S1: done

0:06:08.5 S1: yoga

0:06:08.9 S1: before.

0:06:09.4 S1: But

0:06:10.6 S1: he

0:06:11.2 S1: brought

0:06:11.6 S1: a

0:06:11.9 S1: mat,

0:06:12.6 S1: he

0:06:12.9 S1: brought

0:06:13.1 S1: an

0:06:13.3 S1: open

0:06:13.7 S1: mind.

0:06:14.8 S1: And

0:06:15.0 S1: you

0:06:15.1 S1: know,

0:06:15.3 S1: he

0:06:15.4 S1: really

0:06:15.6 S1: has

0:06:15.8 S1: been

0:06:16.0 S1: feeling

0:06:17.9 S1: pretty

0:06:18.3 S1: stressed

0:06:19.4 S1: from

0:06:19.6 S1: all

0:06:19.8 S1: the

0:06:19.9 S1: planet

0:06:20.3 S1: destruction.

0:06:23.7 S1: So

0:06:23.8 S1: he

0:06:24.0 S1: starts

0:06:24.2 S1: to

0:06:24.4 S1: do

0:06:24.5 S1: a

0:06:24.6 S1: little

0:06:24.7 S1: bit

0:06:24.9 S1: of

0:06:24.9 S1: a

0:06:25.4 S1: stretch

0:06:27.0 S1: and

0:06:27.1 S1: he

0:06:27.2 S1: looks

0:06:27.5 S1: over

0:06:28.2 S1: to

0:06:28.4 S1: his

0:06:28.5 S1: partners...

0:06:31.2 S2: And

0:06:31.7 S2: what

0:06:31.8 S2: do

0:06:31.9 S2: you

0:06:32.1 S2: know

0:06:32.2 S2: his

0:06:32.4 S2: partner

0:06:32.8 S2: is

0:06:32.8 S2: Doug

0:06:32.8 S2: the

0:06:32.8 S2: Pug,

0:06:32.8 S2: his

0:06:32.8 S2: old

0:06:32.8 S2: friend

0:06:32.8 S2: from

0:06:32.8 S2: middle

0:06:32.8 S2: school.

0:06:32.8 S2: "Hey

0:06:32.8 S2: yo

0:06:32.8 S2: Doug,

0:06:32.8 S2: what's

0:06:32.8 S2: happening?

0:06:32.8 S2: I

0:06:33.1 S2: didn't

0:06:33.6 S2: know

0:06:34.0 S2: you

0:06:34.3 S2: did

0:06:34.6 S2: yoga.

0:06:34.9 S2: I

0:06:35.1 S2: didn't

0:06:35.6 S2: even

0:06:36.0 S2: know

0:06:36.3 S2: you

0:06:37.1 S2: were

0:06:37.3 S2: in

0:06:37.4 S2: Vermont.

0:06:37.6 S2: I

0:06:37.7 S2: thought

0:06:37.7 S2: you

0:06:37.7 S2: were

0:06:37.7 S2: in

0:06:37.7 S2: California."

0:06:37.7 S2: And

0:06:37.7 S2: Doug

0:06:37.7 S2: goes,

0:06:37.7 S2: "I'm

0:06:37.7 S2: just

0:06:37.9 S2: here

0:06:39.6 S2: for

0:06:40.9 S2: the

0:06:42.3 S2: summer

0:06:44.6 S2: to

0:06:45.6 S2: get

0:06:46.7 S2: back

0:06:46.8 S2: in

0:06:47.0 S2: some

0:06:47.1 S2: nature,

0:06:47.2 S2: take

0:06:47.2 S2: a

0:06:47.4 S2: break

0:06:47.8 S2: from

0:06:48.2 S2: all

0:06:48.5 S2: this

0:06:48.9 S2: Doug

0:06:49.3 S2: and

0:06:49.5 S2: the

0:06:49.7 S2: Pug

0:06:50.3 S2: and

0:06:50.9 S2: stuff."

0:06:51.6 S2: And

0:06:52.3 S2: so

0:06:52.3 S2: they

0:06:52.7 S2: catch

0:06:53.0 S2: up

0:06:53.1 S2: a

0:06:53.2 S2: bit

0:06:53.5 S2: and

0:06:53.7 S2: then

0:06:54.0 S2: he

0:06:54.2 S2: tells

0:06:54.5 S2: him

0:06:54.8 S2: he

0:06:55.0 S2: chose

0:06:55.3 S2: life

0:06:55.6 S2: and

0:06:55.8 S2: then

0:06:56.1 S2: by

0:06:56.3 S2: now,

0:06:56.5 S2: Cthulhu's

0:06:57.1 S2: feeling

0:06:57.6 S2: pretty

0:06:57.8 S2: warmed

0:06:58.0 S2: up.

0:06:58.1 S1: Right,

0:06:58.3 S1: right.

0:07:00.2 S1: So

0:07:00.5 S1: Cthulhu's

0:07:01.5 S1: feeling

0:07:02.2 S1: pretty

0:07:02.5 S1: warmed

0:07:02.7 S1: up

0:07:03.4 S1: and

0:07:04.2 S1: he's

0:07:04.7 S1: psyched

0:07:05.5 S1: to

0:07:05.8 S1: see

0:07:06.2 S1: Doug

0:07:06.7 S1: the

0:07:07.1 S1: Pug

0:07:07.5 S1: and

0:07:07.8 S1: they're

0:07:08.6 S1: catching

0:07:09.5 S1: up

0:07:09.8 S1: and

0:07:10.1 S1: he

0:07:10.3 S1: says,

0:07:10.5 S1: "Well,

0:07:12.0 S1: what

0:07:12.1 S1: have

0:07:12.3 S1: you

0:07:12.4 S1: been

0:07:12.6 S1: up

0:07:12.7 S1: to

0:07:12.8 S1: recently?"

0:07:13.3 S1: And

0:07:13.7 S1: Cthulhu

0:07:14.1 S1: says

0:07:14.3 S1: "Well,

0:07:14.5 S1: I've

0:07:14.6 S1: been

0:07:14.8 S1: destroying

0:07:15.3 S1: planets."

0:07:15.3 S1: And

0:07:15.3 S1: Doug

0:07:15.3 S1: the

0:07:15.3 S1: Pug

0:07:15.5 S1: says,

0:07:15.8 S1: "Ah,

0:07:16.0 S1: typical

0:07:16.5 S1: you."

0:07:16.7 S1: And

0:07:17.2 S1: Cthulhu

0:07:20.7 S1: says,

0:07:21.0 S1: "How

0:07:21.1 S1: about

0:07:21.3 S1: you?

0:07:21.8 S1: What

0:07:21.9 S1: have

0:07:22.0 S1: you

0:07:22.1 S1: been

0:07:22.3 S1: up

0:07:22.4 S1: to?"

0:07:22.7 S1: And

0:07:23.1 S1: Doug

0:07:23.3 S1: the

0:07:23.4 S1: Pug

0:07:24.2 S1: says,

0:07:25.0 S1: "I

0:07:25.1 S1: have

0:07:25.2 S1: a

0:07:25.4 S1: family

0:07:25.8 S1: now,

0:07:26.0 S1: I've

0:07:26.2 S1: really

0:07:26.5 S1: settled

0:07:26.9 S1: down."

0:07:30.8 S2: And

0:07:31.1 S2: that

0:07:31.3 S2: just

0:07:31.5 S2: shocked

0:07:31.9 S2: Cthulhu,

0:07:32.3 S2: he's

0:07:32.5 S2: like,

0:07:32.8 S2: "Wow

0:07:33.1 S2: Doug,

0:07:33.1 S2: I

0:07:33.2 S2: guess

0:07:33.6 S2: you've

0:07:34.0 S2: totally

0:07:34.5 S2: change

0:07:35.0 S2: of

0:07:35.2 S2: pace

0:07:35.5 S2: there."

0:07:35.9 S2: It

0:07:36.1 S2: started

0:07:36.6 S2: to

0:07:36.8 S2: remind

0:07:37.2 S2: him

0:07:37.5 S2: of

0:07:37.6 S2: all

0:07:40.9 S2: the

0:07:41.1 S2: crazy

0:07:41.5 S2: stuff

0:07:42.0 S2: Doug

0:07:42.4 S2: the

0:07:42.7 S2: Pug

0:07:43.0 S2: has

0:07:43.3 S2: done

0:07:43.7 S2: in

0:07:43.8 S2: the

0:07:44.0 S2: past

0:07:44.2 S2: with

0:07:44.3 S2: all

0:07:44.5 S2: those

0:07:44.7 S2: crazy

0:07:44.9 S2: glasses

0:07:45.1 S2: he's

0:07:45.3 S2: worn,

0:07:45.5 S2: and

0:07:45.6 S2: crazy

0:07:45.8 S2: outfits

0:07:46.1 S2: he's

0:07:46.2 S2: tried

0:07:46.4 S2: on.

0:07:46.5 S2: He

0:07:46.6 S2: goes,

0:07:46.8 S2: "That's

0:07:47.0 S2: cool,

0:07:47.2 S2: that's

0:07:47.4 S2: cool.

0:07:47.6 S2: Everyone

0:07:47.9 S2: goes

0:07:48.1 S2: through

0:07:48.3 S2: different

0:07:48.6 S2: phases

0:07:48.9 S2: in

0:07:49.0 S2: life."

0:07:49.3 S2: He

0:07:49.5 S2: goes,

0:07:49.9 S2: "Doug,

0:07:50.3 S2: if

0:07:50.5 S2: you're

0:07:51.1 S2: no

0:07:51.3 S2: longer

0:07:51.8 S2: doing

0:07:52.3 S2: the

0:07:52.6 S2: Doug

0:07:53.0 S2: the

0:07:53.3 S2: Pug

0:07:53.6 S2: thing

0:07:54.0 S2: then

0:07:54.3 S2: what

0:07:54.5 S2: are

0:07:54.5 S2: you

0:07:54.6 S2: doing

0:07:55.1 S2: now?

0:07:56.5 S2: How

0:07:56.6 S2: do

0:07:56.7 S2: you

0:07:56.8 S2: get

0:07:56.9 S2: by

0:07:57.1 S2: financially?"

0:08:00.2 S1: He

0:07:59.6 S1: says,

0:08:00.1 S1: "Well,

0:08:02.9 S1: I

0:08:03.8 S1: found

0:08:04.1 S1: someone

0:08:04.3 S1: I

0:08:04.4 S1: really

0:08:04.7 S1: care

0:08:04.9 S1: about

0:08:05.2 S1: also,

0:08:05.7 S1: it's

0:08:06.4 S1: a

0:08:06.8 S1: golden

0:08:08.2 S1: retriever

0:08:10.7 S1: and

0:08:11.2 S1: we

0:08:11.4 S1: settled

0:08:11.7 S1: down,

0:08:12.1 S1: we

0:08:12.2 S1: have

0:08:12.4 S1: some

0:08:12.7 S1: kids.

0:08:14.7 S1: For

0:08:14.9 S1: a

0:08:14.9 S1: living,

0:08:15.2 S1: he

0:08:15.3 S1: does

0:08:15.5 S1: real

0:08:15.8 S1: estate.

0:08:16.3 S1: He

0:08:17.2 S1: shows

0:08:18.7 S1: people

0:08:19.0 S1: around

0:08:19.4 S1: California.

0:08:21.2 S1: He

0:08:21.3 S1: really

0:08:21.6 S1: likes

0:08:22.0 S1: it

0:08:22.1 S1: but

0:08:22.7 S1: it

0:08:22.8 S1: could

0:08:22.9 S1: be

0:08:23.0 S1: a

0:08:23.1 S1: little

0:08:23.3 S1: stressful

0:08:23.8 S1: which

0:08:24.0 S1: is

0:08:24.2 S1: why

0:08:24.4 S1: he

0:08:24.5 S1: decided

0:08:25.0 S1: to

0:08:25.1 S1: come

0:08:25.3 S1: out

0:08:25.6 S1: to

0:08:25.9 S1: Vermont

0:08:26.4 S1: to

0:08:26.5 S1: do

0:08:26.6 S1: a

0:08:26.7 S1: little

0:08:26.9 S1: bit

0:08:27.0 S1: of

0:08:27.0 S1: yoga."

0:08:29.3 S2: And

0:08:30.7 S2: then

0:08:31.0 S2: all

0:08:31.2 S2: of

0:08:31.3 S2: a

0:08:31.4 S2: sudden,

0:08:31.8 S2: Doug

0:08:32.3 S2: the

0:08:32.6 S2: Pug

0:08:33.0 S2: gets

0:08:33.4 S2: cut

0:08:33.7 S2: off

0:08:34.1 S2: by

0:08:34.4 S2: this

0:08:34.8 S2: loud

0:08:35.2 S2: sound

0:08:35.7 S2: and

0:08:36.1 S2: then

0:08:36.5 S2: the

0:08:36.8 S2: earth

0:08:37.1 S2: cracks

0:08:39.5 S2: right

0:08:39.8 S2: down

0:08:40.1 S2: the

0:08:40.2 S2: line

0:08:40.4 S2: in

0:08:40.7 S2: between

0:08:41.4 S2: Doug

0:08:41.8 S2: the

0:08:42.1 S2: Pug

0:08:42.5 S2: and

0:08:42.8 S2: Cthulhu

0:08:43.5 S2: and

0:08:43.9 S2: splits

0:08:44.5 S2: aparts.

0:08:45.1 S2: And

0:08:45.5 S2: what

0:08:45.9 S2: do

0:08:46.1 S2: you

0:08:46.5 S2: know

0:08:46.9 S2: it's

0:08:47.4 S2: a

0:08:47.5 S2: succubus,

0:08:48.3 S2: Cthulhu's

0:08:49.2 S2: ex-

0:08:49.4 S2: girlfriend.

0:08:50.4 S2: He's

0:08:50.8 S2: like

0:08:51.3 S2: "Uh

0:08:51.5 S2: oh.

0:08:51.8 S2: Haven't

0:08:52.5 S2: seen

0:08:52.9 S2: you

0:08:53.3 S2: in

0:08:53.5 S2: a

0:08:53.7 S2: while.

0:08:54.2 S2: What

0:08:54.7 S2: brings

0:08:55.3 S2: you

0:08:55.6 S2: up

0:08:55.8 S2: to

0:08:56.1 S2: Vermont?"

0:08:57.9 S1: And

0:08:58.5 S1: she

0:08:59.3 S1: goes

0:09:00.4 S1: "Doug,

0:09:01.4 S1: I

0:09:01.6 S1: know

0:09:01.8 S1: what

0:09:01.8 S1: you've

0:09:02.0 S1: done.

0:09:04.0 S1: You

0:09:04.4 S1: cannot

0:09:04.9 S1: trick

0:09:05.6 S1: Cthulhu

0:09:06.4 S1: here

0:09:07.0 S1: into

0:09:07.5 S1: thinking

0:09:08.5 S1: that

0:09:09.0 S1: you've

0:09:09.7 S1: settled

0:09:10.0 S1: down."

0:09:10.3 S1: And

0:09:10.5 S1: she

0:09:10.7 S1: turns

0:09:10.8 S1: to

0:09:11.0 S1: the

0:09:11.1 S1: Cthulhu

0:09:11.4 S1: and

0:09:11.6 S1: she

0:09:11.7 S1: says,

0:09:11.9 S1: "This

0:09:12.3 S1: man

0:09:14.5 S1: is

0:09:15.0 S1: actually

0:09:15.6 S1: responsible

0:09:17.2 S1: for

0:09:17.4 S1: a

0:09:17.5 S1: lot

0:09:17.7 S1: of

0:09:17.8 S1: those

0:09:17.9 S1: California

0:09:18.8 S1: wildfires."

0:09:20.2 S1: And

0:09:20.5 S1: the

0:09:21.0 S1: pug

0:09:21.5 S1: looked

0:09:22.4 S1: shocked.

0:09:23.3 S1: He

0:09:23.4 S1: says,

0:09:23.6 S1: "How

0:09:23.9 S1: could

0:09:24.5 S1: you?

0:09:24.9 S1: How

0:09:25.2 S1: did

0:09:25.3 S1: you

0:09:25.5 S1: know?"

0:09:27.0 S1: And

0:09:28.1 S1: she

0:09:28.3 S1: looks

0:09:28.5 S1: at

0:09:28.6 S1: him

0:09:29.2 S1: and

0:09:29.7 S1: she

0:09:30.1 S1: says...

0:09:31.3 S2: "Because

0:09:34.1 S2: I

0:09:34.3 S2: helped

0:09:34.5 S2: you

0:09:34.7 S2: start

0:09:34.9 S2: all

0:09:35.0 S2: those

0:09:35.0 S2: fires

0:09:35.0 S2: but

0:09:35.0 S2: I

0:09:35.0 S2: can't

0:09:35.0 S2: carry

0:09:35.0 S2: this

0:09:35.0 S2: guilt

0:09:35.0 S2: with

0:09:35.0 S2: me

0:09:35.0 S2: anymore."

0:09:35.0 S2: And

0:09:35.0 S2: then

0:09:35.0 S2: Doug

0:09:35.0 S2: the

0:09:35.2 S2: Pug

0:09:36.2 S2: his

0:09:37.1 S2: eyes

0:09:38.3 S2: start

0:09:39.7 S2: darting

0:09:41.4 S2: back

0:09:41.6 S2: and

0:09:42.0 S2: forth,

0:09:42.4 S2: he

0:09:42.6 S2: starts

0:09:43.2 S2: panicking.

0:09:43.9 S2: Everyone

0:09:44.6 S2: in

0:09:44.8 S2: the

0:09:44.9 S2: class

0:09:45.1 S2: is

0:09:45.4 S2: looking

0:09:46.0 S2: at

0:09:46.3 S2: him,

0:09:46.6 S2: his

0:09:47.0 S2: gig

0:09:47.3 S2: has

0:09:47.6 S2: been

0:09:48.0 S2: up,

0:09:48.3 S2: so

0:09:48.5 S2: he

0:09:48.8 S2: pulls

0:09:49.2 S2: a

0:09:49.7 S2: knife

0:09:50.3 S2: out

0:09:50.7 S2: his

0:09:51.1 S2: pocket

0:09:51.8 S2: and

0:09:52.2 S2: he

0:09:52.5 S2: goes,

0:09:53.0 S2: "Nobody

0:09:53.8 S2: move.

0:09:54.2 S2: I'm

0:09:54.3 S2: not

0:09:54.4 S2: going

0:09:54.6 S2: down."

0:09:55.0 S2: And

0:09:55.2 S2: he

0:09:55.3 S2: slowly

0:09:55.7 S2: starts

0:09:56.1 S2: backing

0:09:56.5 S2: out

0:09:56.7 S2: of

0:09:56.9 S2: the

0:09:57.0 S2: class.

0:10:00.3 S1: And

0:10:00.5 S1: there's

0:10:00.7 S1: another

0:10:01.0 S1: crack.

0:10:01.7 S1: The

0:10:02.2 S1: earth

0:10:03.0 S1: seems

0:10:03.7 S1: to

0:10:04.1 S1: be

0:10:04.4 S1: splitting

0:10:05.7 S1: in

0:10:06.0 S1: two

0:10:06.4 S1: and

0:10:06.6 S1: his

0:10:07.0 S1: long

0:10:08.1 S1: lost

0:10:09.2 S1: cousin,

0:10:10.6 S1: Jake

0:10:10.7 S1: the

0:10:10.7 S1: Snake,

0:10:10.8 S1: comes

0:10:11.9 S1: up

0:10:13.2 S1: from

0:10:13.4 S1: the

0:10:13.5 S1: earth

0:10:15.4 S1: and

0:10:15.5 S1: he

0:10:15.7 S1: says,

0:10:16.0 S1: "Alright

0:10:17.2 S1: enough.

0:10:18.2 S1: I

0:10:18.5 S1: can't

0:10:19.4 S1: let

0:10:19.9 S1: you

0:10:20.1 S1: take

0:10:20.3 S1: the

0:10:20.5 S1: blame

0:10:20.8 S1: for

0:10:21.0 S1: me

0:10:21.4 S1: any

0:10:21.7 S1: longer."

0:10:24.2 S1: And

0:10:24.4 S1: he

0:10:24.6 S1: pulls

0:10:24.8 S1: out

0:10:25.0 S1: a

0:10:25.1 S1: knife

0:10:25.4 S1: and

0:10:25.6 S1: he

0:10:25.7 S1: holds

0:10:26.0 S1: it

0:10:26.1 S1: at

0:10:26.3 S1: Doug

0:10:26.5 S1: the

0:10:26.6 S1: Pug

0:10:26.8 S1: and

0:10:27.0 S1: he

0:10:27.2 S1: says,

0:10:27.4 S1: "Stop

0:10:27.7 S1: right

0:10:27.9 S1: there

0:10:33.3 S1: and

0:10:33.7 S1: listen."

0:10:33.8 S2: But

0:10:34.0 S2: unfortunately,

0:10:34.4 S2: Jake

0:10:34.4 S2: the

0:10:34.5 S2: Snake

0:10:34.5 S2: is

0:10:34.5 S2: a

0:10:34.6 S2: snake

0:10:34.7 S2: and

0:10:34.8 S2: the

0:10:35.0 S2: knife

0:10:35.2 S2: just

0:10:35.4 S2: falls

0:10:35.6 S2: down

0:10:35.9 S2: because

0:10:36.4 S2: he's

0:10:36.4 S2: a

0:10:36.4 S2: snake.

0:10:36.4 S2: Doug

0:10:36.4 S2: the

0:10:36.4 S2: Pug

0:10:36.5 S2: slaps

0:10:36.5 S2: Jake

0:10:36.5 S2: and

0:10:36.5 S2: says,

0:10:36.5 S2: "You

0:10:36.9 S2: fool."

0:10:38.5 S2: Picks

0:10:40.4 S2: him

0:10:41.7 S2: up

0:10:42.3 S2: and

0:10:42.4 S2: then

0:10:42.7 S2: runs

0:10:42.8 S2: and

0:10:42.9 S2: runs.

0:10:42.9 S2: But

0:10:43.0 S2: also

0:10:43.1 S2: unfortunately

0:10:43.3 S2: for

0:10:43.4 S2: Doug

0:10:43.5 S2: the

0:10:43.6 S2: Pug,

0:10:43.7 S2: he's

0:10:43.7 S2: a

0:10:43.8 S2: pug

0:10:43.8 S2: and

0:10:44.0 S2: can't

0:10:45.7 S2: get

0:10:46.8 S2: very

0:10:47.9 S2: far

0:10:49.3 S2: before

0:10:49.8 S2: Cthulhu

0:10:50.3 S2: picks

0:10:50.6 S2: him

0:10:50.8 S2: up

0:10:51.1 S2: and

0:10:51.7 S2: says,

0:10:52.5 S2: "This

0:10:53.2 S2: behavior

0:10:53.6 S2: can't

0:10:53.8 S2: go

0:10:53.9 S2: on

0:10:54.0 S2: anymore

0:10:54.9 S2: Doug.

0:10:55.4 S2: I

0:10:55.5 S2: think

0:10:55.7 S2: it's

0:10:55.8 S2: finally

0:10:56.1 S2: time

0:10:56.5 S2: you

0:10:56.5 S2: set

0:10:56.5 S2: yourself

0:10:56.5 S2: straight."

0:11:00.8 S1: And

0:10:56.5 S1: Cthulhu

0:10:56.5 S1: puts

0:10:56.5 S1: his

0:10:56.5 S1: hand

0:10:56.5 S1: to

0:11:01.3 S1: the

0:11:01.4 S1: ground,

0:11:03.1 S1: and

0:11:03.3 S1: he

0:11:03.5 S1: starts

0:11:03.9 S1: shaking

0:11:04.8 S1: in

0:11:05.1 S1: pure

0:11:05.5 S1: concentration

0:11:06.5 S1: and

0:11:08.2 S1: shaking

0:11:08.7 S1: and

0:11:08.9 S1: suddenly

0:11:09.3 S1: everything

0:11:10.3 S1: warmed

0:11:10.8 S1: up

0:11:12.7 S1: and

0:11:12.9 S1: that's

0:11:13.3 S1: when

0:11:13.4 S1: they

0:11:13.6 S1: know

0:11:14.5 S1: that

0:11:14.7 S1: things

0:11:14.9 S1: are

0:11:15.0 S1: getting

0:11:15.2 S1: pretty

0:11:15.5 S1: real

0:11:16.2 S1: and

0:11:16.5 S1: Doug

0:11:16.8 S1: the

0:11:17.1 S1: Pug

0:11:17.5 S1: says,

0:11:17.8 S1: "Look,

0:11:18.2 S1: look,

0:11:18.6 S1: Cthulhu,

0:11:19.2 S1: calm

0:11:19.6 S1: down.

0:11:19.9 S1: We

0:11:20.1 S1: can

0:11:20.2 S1: work

0:11:20.4 S1: this

0:11:20.6 S1: out."

0:11:21.0 S1: And

0:11:21.5 S1: Jake

0:11:22.0 S1: the

0:11:22.5 S1: Snake

0:11:23.2 S1: says,

0:11:23.8 S1: "Look

0:11:24.4 S1: man,

0:11:24.9 S1: y'all

0:11:25.6 S1: are

0:11:26.0 S1: tripping

0:11:27.1 S1: right

0:11:27.7 S1: now.

0:11:28.3 S1: We

0:11:28.4 S1: gotta

0:11:28.6 S1: cool

0:11:29.8 S1: off."

0:11:31.5 S2: "Here,

0:11:31.7 S2: let's

0:11:31.9 S2: take

0:11:32.1 S2: this

0:11:32.3 S2: acid.

0:11:32.6 S2: So

0:11:32.8 S2: I

0:11:32.9 S2: must

0:11:33.3 S2: cool

0:11:33.6 S2: off."

0:11:33.9 S2: So

0:11:34.1 S2: they

0:11:34.4 S2: all

0:11:34.7 S2: take

0:11:35.0 S2: the

0:11:35.3 S2: acid

0:11:35.6 S2: but

0:11:35.9 S2: unfortunately

0:11:36.8 S2: since

0:11:37.2 S2: Cthulhu

0:11:37.7 S2: was

0:11:39.2 S2: already

0:11:39.5 S2: in

0:11:39.7 S2: a

0:11:39.9 S2: upset

0:11:40.3 S2: state

0:11:40.6 S2: of

0:11:40.8 S2: mind,

0:11:41.2 S2: two

0:11:41.4 S2: hours

0:11:41.8 S2: later

0:11:42.2 S2: he's

0:11:42.5 S2: in

0:11:42.7 S2: even

0:11:43.1 S2: more

0:11:43.4 S2: upset

0:11:43.8 S2: state

0:11:44.2 S2: of

0:11:44.4 S2: mind

0:11:44.7 S2: and

0:11:44.9 S2: the

0:11:46.2 S2: demons

0:11:47.5 S2: in

0:11:47.6 S2: his

0:11:47.7 S2: inner

0:11:47.7 S2: world

0:11:47.9 S2: are

0:11:48.1 S2: now

0:11:48.3 S2: the

0:11:48.5 S2: demons

0:11:48.7 S2: in

0:11:48.9 S2: the

0:11:49.1 S2: outer

0:11:49.3 S2: world

0:11:49.6 S2: and

0:11:49.7 S2: they

0:11:49.9 S2: are

0:11:50.1 S2: slowly

0:11:52.1 S2: destroying

0:11:55.1 S2: the

0:11:56.2 S2: earth.

0:11:57.8 S2: So

0:11:58.6 S2: Jake

0:11:60.0 S2: goes,

0:12:01.4 S2: "Baa." [chuckle]

0:12:03.7 S1: And

0:12:02.4 S1: Cthulhu

0:12:03.9 S1: goes,

0:12:04.8 S1: "Jake.

0:12:05.6 S1: What

0:12:05.8 S1: are

0:12:05.9 S1: you

0:12:06.1 S1: doing?

0:12:07.5 S1: Why

0:12:07.7 S1: are

0:12:07.9 S1: you

0:12:08.1 S1: throwing

0:12:08.5 S1: up?"

0:12:10.2 S1: And

0:12:10.4 S1: Jake

0:12:10.7 S1: says,

0:12:10.9 S1: "I'm

0:12:11.0 S1: really

0:12:11.3 S1: sorry.

0:12:11.9 S1: When

0:12:12.0 S1: I

0:12:12.1 S1: get

0:12:12.2 S1: this

0:12:12.5 S1: nervous,

0:12:14.6 S1: I

0:12:15.0 S1: just

0:12:15.3 S1: throw

0:12:15.6 S1: up.

0:12:15.9 S1: It's

0:12:16.7 S1: an

0:12:17.1 S1: escape

0:12:18.1 S1: mechanism."

0:12:18.8 S1: And

0:12:19.1 S1: Cthulhu

0:12:19.5 S1: says,

0:12:19.7 S1: "This

0:12:19.9 S1: is

0:12:20.1 S1: not

0:12:20.3 S1: the

0:12:20.5 S1: time."

0:12:21.0 S1: And

0:12:22.0 S1: Doug

0:12:22.4 S1: the

0:12:22.7 S1: Pug

0:12:23.0 S1: says,

0:12:23.4 S1: "Listen,

0:12:23.9 S1: I

0:12:24.1 S1: have

0:12:24.9 S1: a

0:12:25.1 S1: plan

0:12:25.1 S1: but

0:12:25.1 S1: it's

0:12:26.6 S1: gonna

0:12:26.8 S1: take

0:12:26.9 S1: all

0:12:27.1 S1: of

0:12:27.3 S1: us

0:12:27.4 S1: to

0:12:27.6 S1: work

0:12:27.8 S1: together."

0:12:28.3 S2: And

0:12:28.9 S2: Cthulhu

0:12:30.0 S2: goes,

0:12:30.7 S2: "I'm

0:12:31.3 S2: listening."

0:12:32.8 S2: Doug

0:12:33.5 S2: goes,

0:12:34.1 S2: "Alright

0:12:36.1 S2: I

0:12:36.3 S2: know

0:12:36.5 S2: I

0:12:36.6 S2: said

0:12:36.8 S2: I

0:12:36.8 S2: would

0:12:37.0 S2: tell

0:12:37.2 S2: you

0:12:37.4 S2: he

0:12:37.6 S2: plan

0:12:38.0 S2: but

0:12:38.3 S2: just

0:12:38.6 S2: follow

0:12:38.9 S2: my

0:12:39.0 S2: lead."

0:12:40.1 S2: And

0:12:40.3 S2: then

0:12:40.5 S2: he

0:12:40.6 S2: turns

0:12:40.9 S2: around,

0:12:41.4 S2: he

0:12:41.6 S2: barks

0:12:42.0 S2: twice

0:12:42.4 S2: and

0:12:42.7 S2: back

0:12:43.1 S2: comes

0:12:43.5 S2: Michael

0:12:44.0 S2: Jackson

0:12:45.0 S2: moonwalking

0:12:46.0 S2: on

0:12:46.3 S2: his

0:12:46.6 S2: head

0:12:46.9 S2: into

0:12:47.2 S2: the

0:12:47.3 S2: room.

0:12:47.7 S2: And

0:12:48.0 S2: he

0:12:48.2 S2: goes,

0:12:48.6 S2: "We're

0:12:49.0 S2: all

0:12:49.3 S2: gonna

0:12:49.7 S2: take

0:12:49.9 S2: Michael's

0:12:50.2 S2: hamburger

0:12:50.8 S2: ship

0:12:51.1 S2: and

0:12:51.4 S2: get

0:12:51.4 S2: off

0:12:51.4 S2: this

0:12:51.4 S2: earth

0:12:51.4 S2: because

0:12:51.4 S2: Cthulhu,

0:12:51.4 S2: you've

0:12:51.4 S2: destroyed

0:12:51.4 S2: it

0:12:51.4 S2: so

0:12:51.4 S2: now

0:12:51.4 S2: we

0:12:51.4 S2: gotta

0:12:51.4 S2: run."

0:12:51.4 S2: And

0:12:51.4 S2: Cthulhu

0:12:51.4 S2: goes

0:12:51.4 S2: "Uhhhhhh."

0:12:51.5 S1: Cthulhu

0:12:51.4 S1: goes,

0:12:51.4 S1: "Uh

0:12:51.4 S1: guys,

0:12:51.4 S1: I'd

0:12:51.4 S1: love

0:12:51.4 S1: that

0:12:51.4 S1: I

0:12:51.6 S1: don't

0:12:57.1 S1: if

0:12:58.6 S1: I'm

0:13:00.6 S1: gonna

0:13:03.6 S1: fit

0:13:05.6 S1: and

0:13:07.6 S1: this

0:13:10.1 S1: acid

0:13:12.1 S1: that

0:13:12.3 S1: we

0:13:12.5 S1: took,

0:13:13.4 S1: I

0:13:13.8 S1: can't

0:13:14.7 S1: really

0:13:14.9 S1: figure

0:13:15.1 S1: out

0:13:15.3 S1: where

0:13:15.4 S1: the

0:13:15.7 S1: door

0:13:18.9 S1: And

0:13:19.1 S1: Jake

0:13:19.7 S1: the

0:13:20.1 S1: Snake

0:13:20.7 S1: goes,

0:13:21.2 S1: "Uhhh."

0:13:21.7 S1: And

0:13:22.2 S1: he

0:13:22.5 S1: throws

0:13:23.2 S1: up

0:13:23.5 S1: the

0:13:23.9 S1: acid

0:13:24.5 S1: that

0:13:25.0 S1: he

0:13:25.3 S1: took

0:13:25.8 S1: so

0:13:26.1 S1: he

0:13:26.5 S1: can

0:13:26.9 S1: think

0:13:27.5 S1: clearly

0:13:28.3 S1: again

0:13:28.9 S1: and

0:13:29.0 S1: he

0:13:29.1 S1: goes...

0:13:29.5 S2: And

0:13:31.0 S2: he

0:13:32.1 S2: goes,

0:13:33.5 S2: "I

0:13:33.7 S2: can

0:13:35.7 S2: unfortunately,

0:13:37.9 S2: I

0:13:38.0 S2: don't

0:13:39.5 S2: so

0:13:39.7 S2: I'm

0:13:39.8 S2: just

0:13:40.0 S2: gonna

0:13:40.2 S2: sit

0:13:40.4 S2: here

0:13:40.7 S2: and

0:13:40.8 S2: stare

0:13:40.9 S2: at

0:13:41.9 S2: figure

0:13:42.1 S2: it

0:13:42.2 S2: out."

0:13:42.4 S2: But

0:13:42.6 S2: Doug

0:13:42.8 S2: the

0:13:43.0 S2: Pug

0:13:43.2 S2: smacks

0:13:43.5 S2: Jake

0:13:43.7 S2: in

0:13:43.9 S2: the

0:13:44.1 S2: head

0:13:44.7 S2: "You're

0:13:45.0 S2: a

0:13:45.6 S2: And

0:13:45.8 S2: he

0:13:46.2 S2: "Cthulhu

0:13:53.0 S2: let's

0:13:53.5 S2: finally

0:13:54.1 S2: embrace

0:13:55.8 S2: we've

0:13:56.3 S2: been

0:13:56.6 S2: repressing

0:13:57.8 S2: so

0:13:58.0 S2: long."

0:13:58.4 S2: And

0:13:58.7 S2: he

0:13:58.9 S2: leans

0:13:59.4 S2: in

0:13:59.6 S2: to

0:13:59.8 S2: give

0:14:00.2 S2: Cthulhu

0:14:00.8 S2: one

0:14:01.1 S2: last

0:14:01.5 S2: kiss...

0:14:01.8 S1: And

0:14:02.1 S1: they

0:14:02.5 S1: kiss

0:14:02.9 S1: and

0:14:03.2 S1: they

0:14:04.6 S1: they

0:14:04.9 S1: hugged.

0:14:05.4 S1: And

0:14:05.6 S1: they

0:14:23.4 S1: it

0:14:23.5 S1: would

0:14:23.7 S1: be

0:14:26.8 S1: hand.

0:14:27.4 S1: It's

0:14:30.8 S2: Cthulhu

0:14:30.2 S2: returns

0:14:31.4 S2: the

0:14:31.8 S2: gesture

0:14:33.3 S2: and

0:14:33.5 S2: then

0:14:41.8 S2: And

0:14:41.9 S2: then

0:14:42.1 S2: as

0:14:42.3 S2: the

0:14:42.6 S2: planet

0:14:43.1 S2: explodes,

0:14:43.7 S2: Cthulhu

0:14:44.7 S2: "Not
