0:00:00.0 Speaker 1: They were five students, and they decided to go to Maine on a camping trip. It's pretty deserted, they got into the log cabin, and were settling down for dinner, and then they heard a loud noise and went outside to see what it was about. And when they got outside, they saw a lot of smoke, and some trees had been knocked down. And they went over to see what had happened, and there was a giant metal ship that had fallen and knocked over a bunch of trees, and they heard an eerie sound coming from it. They were scared obviously, but also curious, so they went to approach it. Three of them were hesitant, but two of them really wanted to check it out, they went over to it. At first, there was no sign of life or anything but then, a door opened. And then they had a voice saying, "Hi, sorry to bother you, we just stopped off for some food, we're very hungry. And [laughter] we'd like to order a couple sandwiches, and some beer, and a couple sodas if you have it. If you could just throw them into our ship, we'd be very happy." And the students didn't know what to do.

0:02:01.0 S1: They were, obviously, very confused, but they went to check out the faces, and they were shocked to find that they looked just like them, just normal human beings. But they were obviously a little bit different... Their skin color was different, they was purple. And from the front, they looked like totally normal people. But then when they turned around, their entire backside was glowing red. And they said that they were glowing red because they were low on fuel, so they needed some food to re-up their batteries, so they could make the rest of their trip. They seemed friendly, so they brought them back into their cabin, and decided to share their food with them. They had burgers and hot dogs, and when they offered the food to the aliens, the aliens looked horrified. They told them they don't eat meat, so they had to find some other meal to give them. The aliens were pretty surprised that these humans were eating meat. They had heard on their last trip near Earth that everyone on Earth thought it was really cool to become vegetarian, lately. [laughter] And so they were surprised these young people were also... And the students asked them where they were going on their trip, and the aliens said that they were on a vacation with their kids taking a road trip.

0:04:01.5 S1: Yeah, they were going through the Milky Way galaxy on a road trip, on vacation. It was their usual winter break vacation. I guess the kids wanted to see just what it was like down all the other planets, and that's why they went. Yeah, and they said they normally packed more food to eat. But they had gotten in a big argument when they were packing for the trip, and everything was in such a hurry. And the wife was angry at the husband because he didn't go to the market and get the right snacks for the kids. And then the kids were complaining about having to share a bedroom while they were in their travel spaceship, and it was just such a mess that they decided to just take off, and they didn't really pack properly. Yeah, they didn't pack enough food. They were very grateful to the human beings for giving them buns and salads. And once they ate enough food their backsides were no longer red. And they were able to have a real conversation about the difference between human beings and aliens, other than being able to travel through the galaxy.

0:05:31.1 S1: Yeah, one thing about aliens is that they can understand any language because they don't actually listen to the words, they just pick up on peoples' body cues. And they're like... How they're feeling, and like things like that. So it doesn't matter what words you actually say, as long as you emote properly, the aliens will understand you. That was one of the differences that they talked about, was communication. And they were able to pick up that there was a lot of tension in the room between the human beings. They started to inquire as to what had happened to them because they felt a lot of resentment and sadness. They started to ask the human beings about their personal lives, and it kinda turned into a therapy session. [laughter] One of the aliens was actually a talk show host on his home planet, a lot like Dr. Phil. So it was [chuckle] really convenient for them to have him there to mediate because one of the students had just found out that one of the other students had told her not to apply for a job she wanted, and then he applied for it instead and used some of her material. So they were obviously unhappy with each other. To make matters worse, they had been dating for five years, so it was an ultimate decision position between romance and career. So the alien that was the talk show host tried to mediate between them and tried to resolve the situation but it seemed like there was no solution.

0:07:30.7 S1: Yeah, then he was thinking and he was like, "You know, it would be so great for my ratings if I could have two humans on my show arguing about their mundane lives, people would absolutely love it... Aliens would absolutely love it," excuse me. And so he was like, "How would you guys feel about visiting us and coming on my show? And I'll pay you in gold bars." [chuckle] So the humans were really excited about that idea so they decided to get back on the spaceship with the aliens and travel back to their planet called Nardu. And they got into the ship and that was really cool. It was all these mystic gadgets. Things that they hadn't seen before and there was a little bit of a dispute among the humans, how many of them should go and if any of them should stay or what should happen? So two of them stayed behind to record the events that had happened and share them with other humans and wait for the other ones return and then the other two that had been arguing, went off to be on the TV show. And they were super excited. The ship was really cool and they were about to take off and they were getting ready. And they launched into space, sorry I forgot what she said. So they launched into space and went to Nardu and then they noticed some of the strange things about the aliens. They seemed more demanding, not as friendly as when they first encountered them. They were a little bit afraid.

0:09:29.3 S1: Also, the aliens were super excited to take the people and have them on the talk show, that they forgot that it was part of the intergalactic law that you can't just take people into different galaxies and stuff without going through security check. So the Nardu news caught footage of them blasting into Nardu and it was starting to become a bit of a scandal. Yes, and then it reached the political offices of both the Nardu planet as well as the Earth planet, and decided to go to negotiations about how to handle the conflict. It's being tense at first. And so the talk show, Nardu now was projected to have the highest ratings of all time, and the aliens were really, really excited and they kept trying to get the humans more and more upset with each other so that they'll be really exciting to watch on the show. And they kept asking about the job application and also whether or not... Is the job more important or the relationship was more important. To make matters worse, the woman was pregnant but she was hiding it from the man. So they thought that it'd be cool to reveal that on the show, but they also were aware of the political tension.

0:11:31.3 S1: And first the aliens were skeptical, they were like, "Is talking about being pregnant on the show, is that really interesting, or should they say more about the job." And the humans were like, "No, no, you have no idea like on human reality television, people surprise people about being pregnant and having kids and stuff all the time, and it's really popular [laughter] and paternity test and all these stuff so you should definitely put it on the show." The girl told them, "You should definitely put it on the show." The humans were quite surprised that the aliens didn't think their audience would be interested by it because obviously, it's very popular on earth. But they were able to convince the aliens to go that way. But obviously, the people on the conflict who didn't know about this, the other human being knew about it. So but the girl was like, "Yeah, we should talk about it on the show." They were like, "Alright, let's do it." And then, so then the Nardu Police Department was looking around for the humans. So it's like, it's really tense couple days before the show. It's like everyone was worked up on the spaceship and getting ready for the show and building tension. But then they were also kind of hiding out, and trying not to get caught by the cops before the show aired on TV and stuff and they were all gearing up for the big day.

0:13:00.9 S1: It seemed like an impossible situation but the broadcast finally arrived and it seemed like they were gonna get away with it. They were about to go on the air, but then the human started to get sick, I guess they weren't used to the atmosphere on the other planet. And because the woman... Both of them started having convulsions and their muscles started contracting, and it caused the woman to go into labor right when the cameras turned on. So, everyone was tuned in to watch the show, and then it turned out the woman was about to have the first human born on the planet of Nardu. So, that was a pretty big deal and the fact that there was a first human born on Nardu really changed things. It was a great accomplishment for both planets and so everyone was deemed a hero for making this [0:14:20.9] ____ species relationship possible, both political states were happy. Right? So, everyone decided to just let all the legal stuff go 'cause they were so excited about this first human born on Nardu and they interviewed the parents and the dad was like, "Yeah, I can't believe I didn't know she was nine months pregnant. I guess she wore a lot of down jackets all winter [laughter] and then they decided to raise the kid half of the time on earth and half of the time on Nardu and it was gonna be the first intergalactic political representative.
