0:00:00.0 Speaker 1: Alright, first my turn. It started out a normal day but Sally was really tired from going to school she was on the playground. She'd been trying to climb the monkey bar but hadn't quite managed to [0:00:24.2] ____ and stretch her elbow. So she was in a bad mood when she came home from school that day.

0:00:31.3 Speaker 2: Her mom offered to make her a snack but she said, "No mom, I'm too upset to eat right now," and stormed into her room where she began figuring out a way to get strong to be able to do the monkey bars. She searched for workout routines for monkey bar pulling.

0:01:04.6 S1: [chuckle] The internet wasn't really helpful for that. Luckily, she had an older brother and so she thought, okay, I'll go ask him how do I conquer the monkey bars? And she went to her older brother, named Sam, and she knocked on his door but he said, "Go away," which just made Sally pretty sad.

0:01:33.3 S2: After being told to go away, Sally said, "But I wanna get strong like you and so that I can climb the monkey bars." And her brother said, "The best way to get strong is by picking fights with other school children." Her brother has had a record of being a bit of an upstart and a little bit difficult to get along with and this was the beginning of Sally's turn toward doing this.

0:02:05.1 S1: So Sally was a bit confused. She had been the good child in the family but she really wanted to conquer the monkey bars. So she started planning how she would get into fights on the school yard in order to conquer the monkey bars. That night she didn't get much sleep, thinking about them. Eventually fell asleep, ready for the day at school.

0:02:32.1 S2: The next morning her brother woke her up at 5:00 AM and said, "Sally, we're gonna lift some weights." So he brought Sally down to the garage and showed her how to do bicep curls and squats and deadlifts and in general, how to get strong for her days of fighting and monkey bar climbing ahead. Sally was a natural and was soon lifting lots of weight.

0:03:04.5 S1: So Sally's parents thought it was weird that they were getting up so early, Sally and her brother, but that it was good sibling bonding. So they kind of ignored the purpose of the weightlifting and getting stronger. They were just excited to see the siblings playing together. Sally quickly became very very strong with the lifting of the weights.

0:03:32.4 S2: Yep. So Sally decided that she would get on an eight-week training program and then go back to the monkey bars. So after lots of morning sessions with her brother and a few protein shakes, she was much stronger and decided to go back to the monkey bars. She climbed up and put her hand on the first bar determined to get across this time.

0:04:01.4 S1: So she had her hand on the first bar and was reaching, stretching to the second bar, made it. There were 12 bars on this monkey bar routine and she made it halfway across. And so she was starting to lose confidence but she gritted her teeth and she made it a couple more bars and then fell down. She fell off the monkey bars. Tears streaming down her face, she couldn't do it.

0:04:32.1 S2: It was just then that the class bully, Johnny, came over and started making fun of Sally. He said, "Sally you are so weak. I can't believe you didn't make it across the monkey bars." This made Sally very mad and she started to get red and angry. She turned her sadness and her tears into anger and decided that today was the day to show Johnny a thing or two.

0:05:01.5 S1: Normally, she would have shown him with her word but the eight-week training program combined with the time spent with her brother had resulted in a very different motive. Sally had never been in a fight before so she wasn't quite sure what to do. She retreated on the other streets of the playground so she had a general idea but... Her first step, she looked at Johnny and said...

0:05:31.7 S2: "Johnny, you've got something on your shirt." And she pointed her finger at his chest. Just then he looked down and while he was looking down, she slapped him in the nose. He started to bleed from his nose and cry and ran to tell the school teachers what Sally had done. Sally looked at her fist and realized that all of the exercising had made her a much angrier person and maybe spending time with her brother wasn't as so much as it was cracked up to be.

0:06:03.3 S1: Yeah. And in addition to what they refer to as weight rage from all the protein shake, had turned Sally into kind of aggressive person. As she was contemplating of the protein shake to the actual morning workout session, Johnny was coming back across the school yard with the other teacher. Sally quickly thought about how this was going to go down.

0:06:32.0 S2: The teacher said, "Sally, what have you done? You used to be such a nice little girl, and now you're starting fights in the schoolyard?" Sally tried to tell the teacher that Johnny had made fun of her for falling off the monkey bars, but the teacher wouldn't have it. She brought them both into the school and to the principal's office, and described what had happened between the two school children to the principal.

0:06:57.2 S1: The principal had been having a really quiet day in the office when he heard the knock on the door and Sally and Johnny were brought in by the teacher. He was about to eat lunch, 'cause it was lunchtime, and they were out at recess, he was very disappointed that he couldn't finish his garden Gouda bowl, but he put it aside ready to talk to the kids who had gotten into this fight on the schoolyard.

0:07:30.8 S2: The principal noticed that Sally looked much stronger than she did the last time she was in his office for getting extra good grades in school and said, "Sally, is there something that's been going on at home?" Sally described her morning workouts with her brother and her protein shakes that she drinks everyday in order to get strong and the principal knew that something must be wrong. He called Sally's parents and asked them to come in.

0:08:00.9 S1: Sally's parents rushed over from their jobs, Sally had been the easy child, they'd never been called to the office for Sally, only for her brother. So they were both shocked when they got the text from the school to come into the principal's office. When they arrived, they looked at Sally, looked at Johnny whose nose was bleeding, and they shook their heads in amazement, they hadn't noticed that Sally had gotten so strong.

0:08:32.8 S2: They said, "Sally, how could you have done this? Are you learning how to fight from your brother? Is he teaching you to be a violent and aggressive child?" Sally just shook her head and looked up at the sky, she said, "I just wanted to cross on the monkey bars, Sam's been teaching me to get strong but I still can't do it." Her parents were very confused and turned towards the principal.

0:09:03.9 S1: The principal also shook his head, most kids weren't this focused on getting across the monkey bars, they looked at it, decided if they wanted to do it and did it or they gave up. This was a very, very determined young girl, and unfortunately the focus on the monkey bars had resulted in a rather poor outcome for everyone involved. However, Sally was very strong now so maybe she could use this for something else.

0:09:33.0 S2: Yes the problem had been that Sally did not really work on her grip strength, so even though her arms were very strong, she was unable to hold on to the bars the entire way across. The principal who used to be a CrossFit instructor gave her some exercises to do like towel hangs and gripping exercises, and Sally's parents decided to check the contents of these protein shakes.

0:10:04.9 S1: Yeah upon doing so, it turned out everything was not kosher and these protein shakes in addition to having some extra supplements or similar to the protein given to Regina in Mean Girls, so it was not great there, and quickly stopped all purchasing of this protein powder and Sally...

0:10:32.2 S2: It turns out that the extra supplements in the protein powder were actually steroids that Sally's brother had been using to get super strong, and that accounted both for Sally's meteoritic gain of muscle mass and her rage symptoms on the school playground. So the parents decided that they would punish Sally's brother and make sure that they didn't have any more steroid protein shakes.

0:11:05.4 S1: So with the protein shakes out of the way, the other problem was the fact that Sally's grip strength was still sub-par. So in addition to the CrossFit, her parents decided that maybe going through a rock climbing game would be a good idea, so that she could both work on her grip strength and her arm strength and they forced her brother to go along as punishment to watch her.

0:11:30.9 S2: While Sally's brother was bullying her at the rock gym, she decided she really enjoyed it. Climbing up walls was way more fun than climbing across monkey bars and the little plastic holes in the wall really improved her grip strength compared to the weird exercises that her brother had been having her do, like bicep curls and other things that were really only working on her glory muscles she became lean and strong at the climbing gym.

0:12:04.9 S1: This went on for several weeks, Sally climbing at the climbing gym and her brother bullying her. She was mastering all sorts of levels of rock climbing, which is good, and so finally she had pretty much ignored the monkey bars after the incident, but went back on a warm sunny Tuesday to conquer them.

0:12:31.8 S2: This time, Sally made sure that Johnny was there to see. She grabbed the first monkey bar, and she felt so confident that she skipped one of them doing basically every other monkey bar the entire way across and swinging with her added grip strength and pull strength that she had gotten from the climbing gym to easily get across the monkey bars. She stepped on the ground and said, "In your face Johnny, let's see if you can do it."

0:13:00.2 S1: Now, Johnny as a bully was normally very outgoing, but now he was being shown up by a girl, so of course, he rushed up to his first monkey bar, and was very confident, he had seen Sally skip one bar, so he just said, "Alright, I'm gonna do that as well" So he got the first one, skipped the second, made it to the third, and the fifth and then all of a sudden he realized...

0:13:32.6 S2: He was like, "I can't do this, my grip strength is not good enough. Why is the school building monkey bars that are basically impossible for any kids to cross." Johnny fell on the ground and just then Sally was overwhelmed with compassion, she helped Johnny up off of the ground and said, "Johnny, you need to come climbing at the rock climbing gym with me and train your grip strength and forearm." So from then on Johnny and Sally went together after school to the rock climbing gym.

0:14:01.7 S1: It was great, they had completely ignored the monkey bars which the school has been forming investigation into seeing as no one should get across these monkey bars. And they would just go to the climbing gym. After they got very good at climbing up the walls on the ropes, they decided they would tackle bouldering as well, so they spent their afternoons bouldering and climbing at the rock climbing gym.

0:14:31.2 S2: Johnny and Sally grew up climbing together and after high school, decided to take a gap year before college and climb in some of the beautiful places in the world. They went to Spain and France and Thailand to go climbing outside and eventually they became professional climbers. The two of them bought an Astrovan and built it out with a stove and now they live together climbing in the American west...
