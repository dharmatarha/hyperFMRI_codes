0:00:00.0 Speaker 1: Alright, so the scene opens on a small town in Nebraska, and there's a family in that town with six kids. And their house is small, they have three bedrooms and one bathroom, and all six kids have to share the bathroom in the morning to get ready. And it usually is chaotic, but somehow they're making it work, and have been for a while.

0:00:30.4 Speaker 2: So usually it works out pretty well with this family, but this morning, the youngest child, Timmy, really needs to use the bathroom, but his older sister is in there doing her hair and makeup. And he's telling her that he really needs to go, but she won't get out of the bathroom. And Timmy is sitting outside really frustrated and really needs to use the bathroom.

0:01:00.4 S1: Timmy is sitting there and he's knocking on the door and he's banging on the door, and he's kicking the door, and his sister, Stephanie, is inside just doing her hair and makeup like every other day, until Timmy decides that it's time to take charge and reclaim his bathroom privileges. Because as the youngest, he always goes last. So he gears himself up and goes outside and gets the hose from the garden.

0:01:30.6 S2: So Timmy is outside, he's got the garden hose. He's coming back in the house dragging this hose back into the house. He drags it up to the bathroom, and he's waiting outside the bathroom door with the hose. And he kicks the door open and the sister is sitting there shocked, and he turns the hose on and unleashes this cold water mass on her.

0:02:02.0 S1: And first, he starts with her shoes, 'cause they're her good shoes, her school shoes, and since their family doesn't have a lot of money, they all just have one nice pair of shoes. And as she starts screaming and yelling, everyone else in the family can hear, and some other siblings come running. And as they come running and she's yelling and he's yelling, he starts working the hose up towards her perfectly coiffed hair and expertly done make-up.

0:02:31.2 S2: So at this point, the water is going all over her face, her makeup is running down her face, and all of her brothers and sisters are also watching, and this huge fight breaks out, because it turns out, some of the other siblings have also been frustrated with their sister for a long time, so they want Timmy to keep hosing her down, and the other siblings are telling him to stop, and pretty soon, this huge fight just breaks out. And it's all Timmy's fault.

0:03:00.3 S1: Of course, it's Timmy's fault. He's the youngest and the trouble maker. And so they're arguing and deciding, and finally, the second youngest sibling, Jennifer, decides that instead of fighting, they should have a family meeting and decide how and when to do bathroom privileges. And while she's trying to organize the meeting, Timmy turns the hose on her. And so now two siblings are very damp, and the parents downstairs can hear what's happening.

0:03:30.8 S2: So the parents downstairs are Timmy Sr and Donna. And they hear this, this crazy commotion coming from upstairs, and the dad looks out the door and he sees the door is open, then he sees a hose running outside from the garden up the stairs into the bathroom. So he follows the hose up, follows the screams, and sees Timmy hosing his two sisters and everyone else was just screaming.

0:04:00.9 S1: And so Timmy Sr takes charge and tells all the kids to get downstairs into the kitchen, ASAP. And so they all turned off the hose and put the hose back and head downstairs for what will be a brief, because school is coming up, but informative family meeting. And so they're all sitting downstairs, mostly drenched, and Donna is handing out small towels, and the meeting begins, and everyone can tell it's gonna be one of their more tense meetings.

0:04:31.8 S2: Yeah, so the dad just starts saying... He's pretty mad at Timmy. He's upset that the eldest sister wasn't sharing the bathroom like she should have been, but he's really upset with Timmy, because he brought the hose in the house, and they had wood floors in the upstairs and now there's water soaking in all over the floor boards. And he's really upset, because Timmy probably did a couple of thousand dollars worth of damage to the house, and they just can't afford to repair that.

0:05:01.8 S1: So Timmy, immediately, is super grounded, just flat out probably for the rest of his life. And makeup privileges are taken away from Stephanie, the oldest sister. And Jennifer is reminded that she is not in charge of this family. So those are the easy punishments, but Timmy Sr, and Donna both know that something more drastic needs to be done regarding their family bathroom situation.

0:05:29.7 S2: So at this point, little Timmy is really just not having it and he's just not happy with his punishment. And he storms out of the family meeting, and he runs up to his room, and he locks himself in, and his dad starts yelling at him, and he's coming up the stairs to try to get Timmy back out of his room to continue the meeting.

0:06:00.2 S1: But Timmy is stubborn, as we know, and so Timmy Sr is trying to reason with him through the bedroom door. Because this isn't just Timmy's room, it's some other siblings' room as well, so they gotta get him out eventually. And Timmy Sr is trying to think of a way where they can make the money back and get Timmy Jr out of the room.

0:06:30.2 S2: So Timmy Sr is thinking of a way that he can get the money back, and he tells Timmy Jr that they can open up a lemonade stand together. So Timmy Jr is now gonna have to run his own business, and it can be a lemonade stand if he wants, but his dad's also open to hearing other ideas about how he can work to make this money back.

0:07:01.4 S1: And Timmy Jr has an entrepreneurial heart, so this punishment sits well with him. And so, the two get to work, crafting what will be their family's small business. And since Timmy was so adept with the hose, they're going to make a combination, lemonade stand/pet wash/car wash station in their front yard to recoup the money and to teach Timmy Jr a lesson.

0:07:31.7 S2: So yeah, Timmy's pretty excited about this pet wash/lemonade stand/car wash combination, because as we know, he's very good with the hose. So he comes out of his room and he goes back downstairs, and he's in a much better mood. He apologizes to his whole family. They're pretty good to go now. And Timmy, he starts to lay out his plans to craft this business and get it going.

0:08:00.7 S1: And the other siblings realized that while they're all also in trouble due to this water damage, so they think maybe it would be beneficial for them to chip in as well. And it's been very clear from the start that this is Timmy Jr's project, so the arguing is pretty limited. And the other siblings decided they are gonna help out to restore their house and to help their younger brother.

0:08:30.0 S2: Yeah, so the kids led by Timmy Jr start building a lemonade stand. They're going outside, and they're building a lemonade stand. They get that set up, and they get even more hoses so they can wash pets and cars, big hoses, small hoses, all kinds of hoses. And they're putting up flyers around town to get this business going, and now they're open, it's their first day of business.

0:09:00.6 S1: So business opens, and it's pretty slow start mostly 'cause the weather's been good, cars are pretty clean. But eventually, people start noticing that there's a pretty massive operation underway outside of the family home. And slowly but surely, neighbors come by and the neighbors are kinda enjoying the lemonade and then they're bringing their bikes over to get washed, and it's picking up slowly but steadily.

0:09:32.4 S2: So time keeps going by and this lemonade/car wash/pet washing business is really taking off. And it's not soon before Warren Buffett, who I think lives in Omaha, Nebraska, makes his way over to the small town to check out this business with the intention of perhaps offering them money to buy the business, because it's been so successful.

0:10:00.9 S1: And as we all know, Warren Buffett's initial business proposal and plan as a young boy was a combination, beverage station, car wash. So he's really intrigued, and he comes right up to the door and knocks, brings his car, super dirty Tesla, to see if anyone's interested in trying out their skill, and the family opens the door and just can't believe it, because of course, the celebrity from Omaha is on their doorstep.

0:10:31.2 S2: So Warren Buffett's on their doorstep with his Tesla, and out of the back of the Tesla, come three dirty dogs, and he's saying, "Hey, Timmy, if you can do a good job washing my car and washing my dogs and fix me a glass of delicious lemonade, if you can do all that, I'm gonna make you a very, very generous offer on this business that you have going here."

0:10:58.4 S1: And Timmy is nervous. He's pretty nervous by this opportunity, because he wasn't expecting it. But he knows that his family needs the money and he also wants this big break, so he picks the dirtiest dog to start, a Golden Retriever, classic American dog, just covered in mud, and brings him up to the biggest hose, just start rinsing him off.

0:11:29.9 S2: So Timmy starts rinsing the Retriever, everything's going pretty well so far, he's hosing the retriever off, soaping it up, and before you know it, the retriever's clean. And then he starts on the next dog, which is a very dirty and very tiny Shih Tzu. Timmy also has no problem washing that dog. And before you know it, he's done washing the dogs, and he moves on to get a glass of lemonade for Mr. Buffett.

0:12:00.9 S1: Now, previously, the family had been making lemonade with the hose water, just kind of inclusive business model, but they decided that for Warren Buffett, they need to up their game. So they get some real tap water right from the kitchen sink, and mixed up the most delicious batch of lemonade they could have fathomed, with fresh squeezed lemons, real cane sugar, just going all out for this absolute sell of their business model.

0:12:31.5 S2: So they make this awesome artisanal lemonade for Warren Buffet. He tries it, and he just loves it. So he's very, very happy with the way service has gone so far. And now, all Timmy has to do is wash the Tesla. And if he can wash his Tesla and shine these Tesla up, he does a good job with that, then he should be in the clear, and he should be setting his family up for success if he can wash the Tesla.

0:13:01.7 S1: So he approaches the Tesla and is a little bit confused just due to the lack of door handles, but he knows he can work around this. So he gets started, just really delicately cleaning, and all of his siblings join in, and they all take a portion of the car to clean to perfection. And they're going slowly but surely, and after six and a half hours, the Tesla is detailed. And Warren comes over to survey the work that has been done by these poor Nebraskan children.

0:13:30.0 S2: So Warren is, He's coming up to the car, and he's looking around the car, and it looks like everything is up to his standards, and he's pretty excited, he's pretty happy about the work they've done, so he pulls little Timmy aside, and he's prepared to make him a very generous offer for the business. He pulls out a checkbook and he starts writing a number on the check.

0:14:01.8 S1: And the number on the check is $34,000, and Timmy can't even believe it. But he's young, and so his sister sees the number on the check and asks for a bigger number. And another sister comes, Stephanie, from earlier, and she asks for a bigger number, and they're all asking for the biggest numbers until finally, Timmy says, "No. This is what he thinks we're worth. He knows the market, $34,000 is enough for us."

0:14:32.5 S2: So Warren Buffet overhears the children squabbling, and he sort of resonates with him, and he says, "You know what, I'm just gonna pack a couple more zeros on there." And he ends up buying the car wash/lemonade/pet store business for 34 million dollars, and their dad just is in disbelief.
