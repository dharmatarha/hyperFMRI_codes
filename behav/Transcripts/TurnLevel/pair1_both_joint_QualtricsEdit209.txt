0:00:01.0 Speaker 1: Okay, it's my turn. So there's this kid named Billy, and he's on his way to school and it's a long way. It's about a couple of miles and normally this is an uneventful trip. And he's walking to school, and he comes across a dog and the dog seems to be lost. And he tries to find out whether there's a tag on the dog to tell him who his owner is, but there's no tag. And so...

0:00:31.5 Speaker 2: Billy continued walking to school, and the dog started to follow him. The dog followed him over a hill and into the town where the school was. And it kept on barking and yapping and nipping at Billy's heels until they got to the schoolhouse. When they arrived...

0:01:00.0 Speaker 1: The principal said, "You can't bring a dog in here. There are no dogs allowed in the school unless this is a seeing-eye dog. But Billy, since you are not blind, and this is not an emotional support dog, he is not allowed in the school." Billy looked at the dog and the dog looked at Billy, and the dog looked very sad. And so Billy decided that he would somehow find a way to get the dog into the school. And so...

0:01:30.8 Speaker 2: Billy walked around the back of the school to where the dumpsters were, and the little dog followed him. When they got there, Billy petted the dog and it calms down, and then he slipped the dog into his backpack. The dog looked comfortable and happy so Billy put on his backpack and walked back around to the front of the school. He walked right in the front door past the principal, and nobody noticed that he was carrying a dog.

0:02:00.2 Speaker 1: Billy's first class that day was math and so far so good, the dog was very quiet because the dog had found a little granola bar stuck in the bottom of the backpack. And so the dog was munching happily while Billy was doing his algebra and nobody was the wiser. But then math class ended, and Billy had to go to Spanish. As he walked down the hall, the dog could be heard grumbling a little bit. Billy started to cough.

0:02:32.4 Speaker 2: But nobody was fooled, everyone knew that there was a dog in Billy's backpack. Billy's friend Anne came over to him and said, "Billy, what was that?" And Billy said, "I've got this dog. This dog followed me to school." Anne opened up Billy's bag and looked inside, and the dog jumped out and licked her in the face.

0:03:03.2 S1: Anne was taken with the dog too, and so they decided to hatch a plan to store the dog in the principal's office while the principal was on break. And then they would come rescue the dog after their PE practice. So they snuck into the principal's office, and in the principal's closet, they put Billy and left a note for the principal in case he came back. The note said...

0:03:31.0 S2: "Check out this cool dog." They didn't really think it all the way through, because the principal would definitely be angry if they found the dog. But they drew some pictures on the note. They drew a little picture of the dog and hoped that that would cheer the principal up, then they ran out to PE class.

0:04:03.3 S1: After PE class they came back and the dog was still there. So they took the dog out of the closet, realizing that that was probably a pretty dumb idea in retrospect. So they took the dog and they tried to figure out a way to keep the dog quiet until the end of school. So they went behind the school and they found a little shed where there were rooms and other lawn equipment and stuffed the dog...

0:04:31.5 S2: Inside the shed. They went back to their final class before lunch, and for the whole time in class, neither of them could stop thinking about the cute little dog. When lunch period begun, they came outside and they were so excited to play with the dog that they told a bunch of their friends to come over and check it out. They went back to the shed, and...

0:05:01.9 S1: And there was the groundskeeper looking very angry. Apparently, in their absence, the dog had chewed through the back of the shed and left a big gaping hole. And the groundskeeper took the dog by the scruff of the neck and marched the dog back into the school and found the principal. The principal looked very upset and called Billy and Anne's parents. When the phone rang...

0:05:30.8 S2: Billy's dad answered. Billy's dad couldn't quite understand why the principal was so angry and was mostly concerned about the well-being of the dog. He wanted to know if they knew who the dog's owner was and if they could find a way to get the dog back to its home. The principal became extremely angry at Billy's father...

0:06:01.1 S1: And he slammed down the phone and then called Anne's mother. When Anne's mother answered, she had the same response as Billy's dad. This made the principal extremely angry because he realized that the parents did not respect school discipline. So he slammed down the phone on Anne's mother as well prompting Billy's dad and Anne's mother to call each other to compare notes. Then when they...

0:06:30.6 S2: When they found that the... When they talked to each other, they realized that the principal's problem was not so much with the dog or Billy and Anne's behavior, but was maybe about their own complicated feelings about... I don't know, childhood and enjoyment of life.

0:07:00.7 S1: So Billy and Anne decided that they were gonna drive to the school and talk to the principal and maybe have a heart-to-heart about what it means to be a child, and what is the purpose of education in the grand scheme of life. Including how to be a good citizen and how to commit your life to service. So Billy's dad picked up Anne's mom, and together they went to the school.

0:07:33.0 S2: They arrived and went directly to the principal's office, where Billy and Anne and the principal were waiting but the principal remained angry. But Billy and Anne were becoming increasingly upset about the state of the dog. The dog had run off and nobody knew where it was, and they were upset that the principal didn't seem to care.

0:08:00.3 S1: So Billy and Anne left their parents and the principal having a heart-to-heart session about something, about life and childhood that they didn't understand, and they went in search of the dog. They figured school was not as important as figuring out what had happened to the dog and whether it was okay. So they walked straight out the front door of the school and split up while they searched for the dog and tried to find him.

0:08:31.1 S2: They walked down Main Street asking each of the shopkeepers if they had seen a small dog, and they described the dog. Nobody had seen the dog until they got to the hardware store. When they go to the hardware store, they asked the owner, and the owner said, "Oh, I haven't seen that dog today, but it sounds like you're describing old man Caruthers' dog."

0:08:57.7 S1: Old man Caruthers was a very spooky character in the town. In fact, the kids weren't sure that anybody had ever really seen him. He lived in this very creepy, dark house where the windows were all broken out on the edge of town. Some kids had dared them before to go inside, but they were too scared to do so. So they decided that together, they were brave enough that they would go find old man Caruthers' house.

0:09:33.3 S2: Matt and Terry, if you're listening to just put... Okay, it's back. Fantastic. So they walked out past the center of town, out to the edges, down the side streets and cul-de-sacs trying to find old man Caruthers' house. When they finally found it, the sun was beginning to set.

0:10:01.2 S1: And they looked at each other and they decided that they were gonna go through with it. But it was dark and they were scared. So they opened up the creaky gate with a really weird sound, and they walked towards the front door. Suddenly, a black cat shot across their path. They looked at each other and shuddered. And then they got to the front door and they knocked.

0:10:31.5 S2: After they knocked they heard creaking sounds coming from inside the house as somebody walked across an old wooden floor. The person got to the door and looked at them through the peephole and then they heard a voice from inside saying, "Who is it? Who's knocking on my door?"

0:11:02.9 S1: Billy and Anne grabbed each other's hand tightly and Billy said, "Mr. Caruthers, it is Billy Johnson here from down the street and we were wondering if you had a dog and whether you had seen it lately? Because we saw a dog and we had it for a while, but it's ran away, and the man at the hardware store said... "

0:11:31.4 S2: "That it looked like it was yours." Then suddenly, the old man opened the door. He was very tall, over six foot and extremely skinny and was wearing what looked like old army boots and an army jacket. And he said to Billy and Anne...

0:12:01.0 S1: "Why don't you come into the house, and I'll make us some lemonade?" Billy looked at Anne, and Anne made a quick shake of the head gesture to indicate that they shouldn't do this, but Billy squeezed Anne's hand more tightly and said, "We would love to." So Billy and Anne went into old man Caruthers' house and old man Caruthers shut the door. He turned towards the kitchen and walked slowly away.

0:12:32.2 S2: Billy and Anne followed him into the kitchen, and the old man opened up his refrigerator and pulled out a giant sack of lemons, and put the lemons on the counter and began cutting them open. The old man then said, "That does sound like my dog, and I haven't... "

0:13:01.5 S1: "Seen him in a couple of days, and I've been very, very worried." As Billy and Anne sat there listening to old man Caruthers and seeing him cut up lemons, their eyes wandered around the room, and saw lots of old photographs of old man Caruthers as a younger man with little children, and also old man Caruthers with his army friends at some sort of war.

0:13:31.5 S2: And they also saw a picture of him, which looked like it was maybe 10 years old, with the tiny little dog. When Billy saw this, he jumped up and said, "It is your dog." And then he told the story of what happened, that he had just found the dog when he was walking to the school, tried to take care of it during the day, but ran off when the teachers interfered. Old man Caruthers laughed and kept on cutting lemons.

0:14:03.6 S1: And just at that moment, there was a scratching sound. They didn't know what it was at first, and Billy looked at Anne, and old man Caruthers seemed like he didn't hear it. But then it kept going, and then there was a yelp. Billy and Anne suddenly stood up and went to the door. They opened the door and there was the dog. Old man Caruthers' eyes lit up, and he saw his own...

0:14:33.9 S2: His own faithful companion of many years had returned home. Old man Caruthers continued cutting lemons and Billy and Anne realized that their work there was done. They bid the old man farewell and returned to their parents to tell them what had happened.
