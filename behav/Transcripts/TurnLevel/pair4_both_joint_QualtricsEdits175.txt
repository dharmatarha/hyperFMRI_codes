0:00:00.0 Speaker 1: Oh man, I'm always the starter. Alright, so once upon a time, there was a family known as the Joneses. And this was a very, very ordinary family; they had a white picket fence, they lived in Maryland... The State of Maryland, and everything was pretty normal. You had a mom, a dad, a big sister, big brother... But then one little brother named Tommy. Tommy! Tommy was about seven, and he really enjoyed playing in the woods. However, his family didn't know about this, so Tommy would skip school sometimes, or on the way back home, he would go to the woods and play around, like, build his own little houses, and like... Track animals, and this kind of stuff, you know? So one day, he started to... He started to build a new house for the squirrels. He's like, "You know what, the squirrels are my friends, I want them to have a house." But he needed the materials. He's like, "Where am I gonna get the materials to build a nice shelter for my friends, the squirrels? So I've got these things around me in nature. There's a lot of... A lot of twigs and things like that, but I feel like I need more materials to make this a nice place for the squirrels."

0:01:28.9 S1: Then he reminded himself, "Oh, there are lumberjacks! There are people who cut trees to get lumber. He decided to visit one of the places where they actually cut trees, and he followed the lumberjack back to the mill to see what is happening with all the trees and the wood and lumber that they cut. So he found the place that they cut the lumber, and he... And Tommy's very sneaky. He found the place where they cut the lumber, but the lumberjack didn't know that this little seven-year-old boy was following him. So Tommy managed to actually sneak into the lumberjack's house. He's following around... He's not trying to be bad, he's just... He's very curious about the lumberjack's work, how the lumberjack cuts the wood, and the different kinds of wood, and things like that, but... He's so quiet, and he's so sneaky, and he's kinda small that nobody sees him. He's able to walk around undetected. Yeah, so he spent some time in the... In the lumberjack's house, and he also went to his garage when the lumberjack was making his own little sculptures. And he was making sculptures of squirrels and the rabbits and all of the other animal life that you could see in the woods. And little Tommy was so enchanted with this that he actually took one of these wooden squirrels with him to put it in the squirrel house.

0:03:00.7 S1: He thought, "This would be perfect! Look at this squirrel! It'll be, like, on the mantelpiece of my little squirrel house." And he... He didn't think the lumberjack would mind; the lumberjack had so many. So he took this little one right at the end, and he scurried away back to his squirrel house. But what he didn't know is that the lumberjack was actually making that one special for his daughter. It had a special engraving on the bottom of it. It was made special for the daughter. So when the lumberjack got back to the garage, and he saw that the squirrel was gone, he got really mad, and he started to shout at everybody; at his daughter, at his wife, and at all the neighbors, asking, "Where is the squirrel? Who saw the robbery? Someone took my squirrel!" And actually, one of the neighbors saw little Tommy going out of the house. So he's like, "I saw someone take your squirrel, we need to find this... This little boy!" Because the neighbor didn't recognize his face, so they decided to organize a search party. Tommy also looked very dirty 'cause he had been playing in the woods, so he had dirt all over him, and twigs, and... And they're like, "This looks like a wild... A wild forest boy, like a little squirrel boy... Stealing squirrels." So they all organized, and they're like, "We have to find this boy that's living in the woods!"

0:04:30.6 S1: Meanwhile, Tommy got back to his playground in the woods. He put the squirrel in the little squirrel house and went back home. He was very excited, so the next day, in the morning, he ran back to the woods, and he saw that the squirrels actually had bitten the wooden squirrel, and the squirrel was now so badly destroyed, "Oh, the squirrels just were so excited about their little squirrel friend, they clawed at him and all this stuff!" So he was... He was really messy, but Tommy was kind of excited. He was like, "Oh well. At least they really liked... They liked the squirrel, but I wish that it wasn't destroyed. Maybe if I take him back to the lumberjack, the lumberjack has some kind of enamel coating or... Or protection. I can get him fixed, I can... Get him fixed up, and paint him so that he's protected, so the squirrels can't do that again to him. But meanwhile, the lumberjack and all the neighbors got to Tommy's house, and then they asked Tommy's parents, "Oh, so have you seen this little boy with my little squirrel? I was making this one for my daughter's birthday." So the parents said to him, "Well, actually, we do have a little boy, Tommy, and he really likes to play in the woods." So when Tommy was back home, everybody was expecting them, pretty angry.

0:06:01.6 S1: He walks to the front door, and there's an angry mob in the living room. He's like, "Woah, so many people! We're really meeting the neighbors! I guess mom's having a party." But his mom was not having a party. And they're like, "That's him! That's the little boy that I saw!" And they decide that... Tommy actually freaks out, he's like, "Oh, no I didn't mean to do anything wrong." So he runs out of the house, he runs away, he doesn't wanna get in trouble. So he runs into the woods but unfortunately, he slips on one of the rocks and falls down to the river. The river takes him a little bit down but he manages to swim out but he's very, very far from home now. So he doesn't know where he's, he cannot find the way back and finally, his parents got to know that he's gone missing because he's not coming back home for too long. Yes, so, everyone's like, "Oh no, we have to find him, he's in trouble but we don't want him to get hurt or lost." So they organize a search party, meanwhile Tommy is trying to figure out what to do, he's like, "I'm lost, I'm in the middle of the woods." Luckily because he plays in the woods so often, he's pretty familiar with the woods, he knows how to climb trees and what kind of berries are good to eat and what aren't, and he actually has a bunch of his squirrel friends, so he's like, "You know what? Like people, we gotta find a way back but I'm gonna be okay for now."

0:07:30.5 S1: So he spends the day in the woods, he eats the berries, and tries not to go too far away, however, he still doesn't know the way back, but at some point, he hears noises and he gets really, really scared because the noises did not resemble anything that he knows. It's not a squirrel and it's not a rabbit. It has to be something big going out of the woods. So he's really scared, it's getting kinda dark, he's hearing this big noise, sounds like something really big is coming through the trees, so he scurries up and he climbs the tree just like one of his squirrel friends, so he's in the tree and he's looking down and the noise just gets closer and closer, he's super scared, and he's like, "What is this, what is this gonna be?" And it turns out that there is a bear in the woods, walking through the woods. Well, the bear doesn't really take care of Tommy but what he then found is the little squirrel, the wooden squirrel that Tommy left when he started climbing the tree. So, the bear tries to eat the little squirrel but of course, it's wooden so it doesn't taste very well. So well, uninterested, he just walks away because there's nothing for him.

0:09:00.9 S1: But at this point, so the bear's gone, Tommy's like, "Woah, that was a close one, that could have been really bad. I didn't know there were bears in these woods, that seems unsafe." But he's in the tree now and he's like, "Oh, I'm so high up. I'm like a squirrel, I can maybe see my way home." So he keeps climbing higher and higher, and he's not afraid of heights luckily and he gets to the top of the tree and he realizes, "Oh, I can kinda see, I can see where the river goes, I can see it heads kinda this way. I think that's my neighborhood up there." So finally he knows the direction to go back home but unfortunately, it's not so easy to get down the tree. It was easy to go up but it's not so easy to go down. But luckily he finally hears some people shouting, "Tommy, Tommy where are you? Tommy come back we are looking for you." So he starts to scream back, "I'm here, I'm here." So he's screaming, "I'm here guys, I'm over here." Unfortunately, the bear hears all of this. Well, unfortunately the bear hears the commotion, it scares the bear away. Let's not deal with this bear. The bear runs away, hears all the people coming and the party is like, "Oh, he must be this way." So they're kinda getting closer and closer but they can't see him. They are like, "Tommy, wait up. We can hear you but we can't see you. Where are you?" He's like, "I'm up, you got to look up." So they look up and they see him.

0:10:31.4 S1: They look up and they see him but they also see a bear coming in front of them, so there's like four or six people looking for Tommy and the bear coming towards them. The bear's really angry right now because he wouldn't expect these intruders and he starts to rush up the group. Tommy is super scared, he says, "No watch out for the bear, there's a bear coming, no watch out for the bear." But he could not do anything from up the tree. And then he looks around and he sees that there is a hornet's nest right by him, he's so high up, he's really near this hornet's nest and he's like, "I have to help them, I have to save them." So Tommy crawls along the edge of this branch and he's balancing and he ends up, he's able to kind of grab the top of the hornet's nest and he gets stung a couple of times on his hands and it really hurts but he has to save the people so he throws the hornet's nest down at the bear and it lands right on the bear's head. And it hit the bear so strongly that the bear just fell down and kind of lost his consciousness, so he was lying there without movement. Well, at this point the entire group didn't know should they be worried about Tommy or the bear but they discovered that the bear will be fine so they started to take Tommy down from the tree.

0:12:00.5 S1: Yeah, the bear's kinda dazed and confused, got hit by the thing, got stung all a bunch by the bees, he's not messing with anyone anymore, he's out. So, they're like, "Alright, we gotta figure out how to get Tommy down from this tree. How are we gonna get him down?" So they are not as good of climbers as Tommy 'cause they don't live in the woods but the lumberjack is like, "Well, I could cut the tree down." His friends are like, "No, I don't think that's a good idea. Tommy will fall." But the lumberjack is a very stubborn person and he says, "Well, I will do it anyway." So he starts to cut the tree, he starts to use his axe, and the tree is half taken and Tommy says, "Oh, no it's shaking, I don't know if I can do it." But the lumber says, "Yeah, hold on." And the tree falls down with Tommy on the top. Oh, so the tree is falling, falling, it's a really big tree. The lumberjack says, "Everybody get out of the way." It's falling but luckily, they are super close to the river, Tommy didn't move that far away from the river, so he's able to... At the last minute he jumps off the tree, and he lands in the river, and the current isn't too strong this time so he just splash-lands in the water and is swimming and all the people run off and they're swimming to him and they manage to get him out and get him on the dry land.

0:13:31.9 S1: So finally Tommy was rescued and the bear is also okay so they come back home pretty happy but in the end, the lumberjack still lost his squirrel. So he asks Tommy, "Well, now you'll help me in my... In the garage, so we will work together because my daughter will have her birthday the next week and we need to have a bunch of wooden squirrels now." So, they agree, Tommy needs to help him make a new squirrel because he stole the old squirrel. So Tommy and the lumberjack, they start working on it and the lumberjack is showing Tommy all of his special wood-making skills, he starts teaching Tommy about the different kinds of wood which Tommy really likes 'cause Tommy is in the woods all the time so all this is super interesting to him, he's like, "Yeah, like I actually really find this very interesting, Mr. Lumberjack, do you think that I could continue to be your apprentice and keep learning about how to cut down wood and make wood things?" And this is how a seven-year-old Tommy decided to become a ranger in the national park later on in his life. So he spends a lot of time with lumberjacks, learning about woods and crafting and sculpting different sculptures, and in the end when he was about 20-something, he became a ranger in the national park. Yes.
