0:00:00.9 Speaker 1: So one day, in Fort Summer House, a group of blockmates found themselves hanging out in their common room just going on and on about their favorite things about being at the MoHo, one of which was the fact that they had a common room to hang out in. And they were so glad they weren't at Adam's, where there wasn't such a luxury.

0:00:32.4 Speaker 2: Another reason these students loved Fort Summer House was because of the amazing outings that the tutors planned. They were all signed up the next day to go on an outing with one of their favorite tutors who was going to take them to a site that was rumored to have magical powers. The students were pretty sure they didn't believe in the magical powers but they loved the trip.

0:01:00.1 S1: So the day comes when they're preparing to go out on the bus and they're all meeting in the main entryway and there are about 12 of the students there, and their favorite tutor, who is named Bob, shows up and says, "Come on kids, we're gonna go get in the Lyft that I've ordered." And so all of them go out the front door and wait for the Lyft to arrive.

0:01:30.0 S2: They're waiting and waiting and waiting for the Lyft and it's so unreliable that they decide to switch to Uber instead. They feel grateful to live in such a time when they're able to just conjure up transportation from their smartphones. The Uber arrives and it's a large Uber XL and they pile in, meanwhile giving the Lyft driver very negative reviews.

0:02:00.8 S1: Now they're all squeezed into these Ubers and on the one hand, some of them are feeling a little like it's too close for comfort but some of them are also just deeply thrilled to have friends that they can get so close with. And they're singing story... They're singing songs and telling stories to each other as they're going in this Uber on the way to the magical destination, all full of great anticipation.

0:02:29.2 S2: They arrive at their magical destination, they give their Uber driver five stars and they hope that he returns with five stars of their own 'cause they are all quite concerned about their Uber ratings. And they pile out onto this land and it's definitely not what they expected, they look around and they can't really see anything.

0:03:00.1 S1: They can't see anything 'cause all they see is a giant, ancient forest. And this is the kind of thing that reminds them all of the Forbidden Forest from Hogwarts, the little ancient, wise and trees. There are some squirrels that look like they have beards longer than Gandalf. They're just really feeling lots of things about the forest.

0:03:32.0 S2: They, as a group, are nervous about exploring but their tutor, Bob, has always been adventurous and his adventure and enthusiasm is so contagious that they just can't help but follow him. They start walking towards the tree that looks like it came right out of a Harry Potter film and they get closer to it.

0:04:00.3 S1: They're walking up to this tree when all of a sudden, above them, they hear a loud pop. A pop is a little bit of an understatement, it was more like a deafening explosion. They look into the sky and they see a blinding light that seems to be hurtling right at them. And now all of them start screaming 'cause they're full of panic.

0:04:29.3 S2: They're screaming and running around and furiously opening the Uber app on their smartphone so they can try to get a quick getaway, but Bob, their fearless leader Bob, says, "Stop panicking you kids. Trust me. This is why we're here. This is why I've brought you here. This is when the outing begins."

0:04:58.7 S1: And in that moment, they pause, they trust Bob, and are hit by the blinding white orb. A little squirrel just gazes at them trying to figure out what happened because something that was... A moment that was so full of panic has turned into a silent, quiet, slightly eerie situation.

0:05:28.6 S2: So the students are staring, the squirrel is staring at the students, and Bob seems to have this look of anticipation on his face, hopeful anticipation. The light becomes less intense to stare at and the students realize that it's a ship that was touching down right where they're standing.

0:06:00.2 S1: It's this beautiful, reflective, mirror-cural ship that even though it looks like it plowed straight into the earth, has somehow positioned itself so it's upright. And even though they don't see a door at first, there's a faint outline that slowly darkens and opens from the right to the left and out walks...

0:06:27.2 S2: Out walks what can only be described as an alien. It's an alien that you would think of when someone says, "Think of an alien." The students couldn't believe how prototypical it looked and now it was there in front of them, and they started to wonder what does Bob have in mind for this outing.

0:07:00.8 S1: And the alien slowly descended from the ship, and the students stared in awe as the alien walked over to Bob, some of them were very concerned as it got closer, one step, the next step, the next step, until it reached out its arm and gave Bob a high five.

0:07:26.2 S2: The students were shocked, they figured, if an alien was gonna greet someone, surely it would go with a proper handshake but this alien seemed to be comfortable with Bob and Bob, likewise, seemed to be comfortable with the alien. They gave each other a high five and then they embraced each other just like Bob would do with one of his close friends. The students were very very confused.

0:08:00.0 S1: And that's when Bob changed. His skin lost its typical brown hue and instead transformed to the prototypical green that they saw in the alien. Needless to say the students were very surprised, except for one, little Tracy who had somehow suspected Bob was an alien all along.

0:08:26.1 S2: Tracy was relieved, she felt like the insane girl that thinks her friends are aliens and now she felt validation that her suspicions had been correct. Nothing feels better than to feel validated. Other students started to wonder, did their house masters know that Bob was an alien before they hired him as a tutor? Was this a way to increase diversity within our house? 

0:08:58.5 S1: And other students were still very concerned, in fact, one of them, Larry, could not stop screaming, he was so horrified by what he saw in front of him. Now little Tracy tried to turn to Larry and console him, but he would have none of it. In fact, he was tempted to run away from the group, deeper into the woods.

0:09:31.1 S2: Bob realizes he has to address the students. Larry won't stop screaming and it's starting to become a real problem. Bob faces the students with his alien friend and raises his hand, Larry stops screaming in response. Bob explains, "The reason why I've brought you here is the following.

0:10:00.0 S1: I love you and I wanted you to know the truth, and you couldn't know the truth unless I showed my true colors. I've come to Earth in order to help young humans discover true empathy for, not only themselves, but all creatures throughout the universe.

0:10:28.5 S2: The students were inspired by the show of affection and the show of honesty, they decided that they wanted to show their true colors as well. The students were all humans, don't get me wrong, but they all carried secrets. Secrets of self-doubt, fears of the future, family issues, they laid it all out there. They showed their true colors.

0:11:00.5 S1: Now this process went on for quite some time, and thank goodness, Larry stopped screaming about an hour in, so that was good. People were relieved by that, but needless to say, they created a campfire and they had many s'mores and they had an incredible evening talking about all of their hidden secrets.

0:11:29.9 S2: Now that the purpose of the outing had been achieved, Bob had to make a choice. Bob had to decide whether to go back with his alien friend to his alien home or whether to continue influencing the lives of students in Fort Summer House. He was torn, he left his home and he missed it and he hadn't been there in a long time, but he loved his new house as well.

0:12:00.7 S1: Bob was stuck in a real conundrum, he felt affection for people across such a large divide, and what was really touching was that, not only Bob's alien friends, but the students themselves could observe the struggle that Bob was experiencing. So they went up to Bob the alien and they said, "Bob, how can we help you? How can we help you figure this out?"

0:12:30.5 S2: And Bob said to them, "You need to do to others what I've done to you. You can be 12 aliens and you can continue to bring groups of students together, convince them of the power of showing your true colors and see this forward."

0:13:00.2 S1: It goes without saying that the students were overcome with emotion, not only when they realized Bob's deep respect for them, but also when they recognized that Bob was leaving. Larry was also confused how Bob was going to give up a prestigious Harvard PhD, just like that, but Tracy understood that advancing intergalactic empathy was a better goal.

0:13:31.9 S2: And a Harvard PhD didn't mean anything outside of earth's atmosphere, which the students were disappointed to find out overall, just as a fact. Bob felt sad. He realized that his time was about to come and he was about to leave the earth and return home finally.

0:14:00.2 S1: So each of the students took turns saying farewell to Bob and it was a very touching affair, they took time to share with him their gratitude of some of their favorite memories, they even gave him some gifts. One of them always carried a stone in her pocket that she had gathered from her child play school, and she felt that Bob should take it with him on his galactic adventures.

0:14:28.8 S2: Bob was touched and he couldn't handle any more goodbyes so he boarded his spaceship, got in with his friends and it went away in a blinding flash of light. The students were sad but then ultimately horrified when they realized they had just met two aliens and they hadn't documented a single bit of it. No one would believe them. Larry started screaming and screaming at the missed...
