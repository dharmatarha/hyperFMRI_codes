0:00:00.3 Speaker 1: Okay. So there's a class of students in Dartmouth, and they were studying earth and planetary sciences, and they decided to go on a field trip. And the professor decided to take them to one of the sites that he does research at.

0:00:29.3 Speaker 2: So at this site, the students are really excited and they break up into different groups and start deciding how they're going to identify whether there are aliens there or not. And they start sort of arguing about what the best way is to do that, and they're not agreeing about how to test if that is true.

0:01:00.5 S1: So the students break into two groups, the first group decides to look inside of a cave, and they take a lantern and they wander into the cave. And with their lanterns, they reveal a series of drawings, and they try to figure out where they came from.

0:01:30.0 S2: So then the group that discovered the drawings calls over all the other students and professors to come look at them, and everyone brings their expertise to it. Some of the drawings have different historical roots and different language roots, and they start putting it all together into one cohesive dialog.

0:02:00.7 S1: So then a divide forms in the group, with some of students saying that the drawings must be from aliens and other students believing that the drawings must be from cavemen. So they decide they have to resolve this to figure out whether they came from cavemen or aliens.

0:02:30.3 S2: So the fight gets really bad, and they get... There's a lot of social division, people are getting very ostracized from the differing views because people are taking it really seriously. It matters whether it's aliens or cavemen. And then they start pointing fingers at each other for what their motivations might be and why somebody would want it to be aliens.
