0:00:00.0 Speaker 1: So Sally lived with her father and mother in the deep swamps of Louisiana. And every morning she'd wake up, and she'd take their the boat out into the swamps, and see the alligators and see the storks swim or fly, and catch fish, and she just lived a very peaceful, remote life, never interacting much with anyone beyond her house.

0:00:28.9 Speaker 2: As she explores those swamps in Louisiana, always by her side there's her little sidekick, her little toy alligator, and he is called Croc, although he's a gator it doesn't make sense to call him Croc, but that's just what she called him. And she and her toy gator in the boat all the time, they're having the time of their life.

0:01:00.3 S1: And so one day she takes the boat out with her toy, and she takes it really, really far out into the bayou. And you have to know that this girl, Sally, she never really has interacted with anyone else besides her parents, and maybe the occasional other bayou fisher. She doesn't know what's school like, she doesn't know what going to the grocery store is like, they're pretty self-sufficient eating gator.

0:01:29.9 S2: And she is super far away from home at this point, but she knows it's gonna be fine, she knows the swamp, I mean it's her home, and she knows every tree and every river corner, but night comes and it's falling down, it's getting darker, and she's on her way back but for some reason, she's slower than usually.

0:01:55.0 S1: And she's just taking her time getting back, and the stars start to come out, and she just decides to kick back in her boat and just look at the Milky Way, and it's never been so dark, the moon isn't even out, it's just brand new moon, pitch-black perfect beautiful Milky Way. And she just hears, hears a rustle and a motor starting slowly behind her.

0:02:29.0 S2: So the second boat is pulling up next to her under the pitch-black night sky, and in the boat, there's this shady-looking dude, he has a hood that's pulled over his face, you can't really see what's going on. You can't see his eyes, and Sally is getting kind of scared, she doesn't really... She's never really interacted with people and this person's coming straight toward her.

0:03:00.2 S1: And she just sits really still, and pretend that she's asleep, to see if this person will just go away, but the guys just collides his boat with her, and just hops into her boat and she starts freaking out, and springs open her eyes, And this person pulls their hood off and it's actually a grandmother.

0:03:29.4 S2: It's her long-lost grandmother who visits them every two to three years. And this old woman, she just got lost in the swamp because she's not there very often, and she just made a wrong detour at some point. So now it's Sally and the grandmother in the boat, and it's in the middle of the night, in the middle of the swamp.

0:04:00.3 S1: But Sally really only met her grandmother a couple of times, and she's kind of confused, and recognizes the woman, but doesn't really know the significance of why she's there, and the reason that she only visits every few years is it's because she's really not on good terms with her kids, 'cause she thinks that the kids are not giving their daughter the life that she deserves because they were not educating her, they're restricting her to the swamp.

0:04:28.6 S2: So what the grandmother does is she takes Sally into the other boat, turns it around, and bolts. She's trying to leave, she's trying to kidnap little Sally, and she just tries to leave the swamp, go for an actual city, take her to an actual school, teach her English, teach her maths, and actually she has kind of an okay plan for the kid, that's what child protective services would do, right? 

0:04:57.5 S1: But as she's pulling out she decides that she needs to try and leave some convincing evidence that would make it so that the parents wouldn't come after the daughter, and so she pours gasoline all over Sally's boat and just lights it on fire. And the entire thing just explodes massively, and shrapnel ends up hitting the grandmother and Sally.

0:05:29.2 S2: And now Sally is super mad at the grandma because, her toy alligator, the Croc, was still on the boat, and it's her only friend and it's the only thing that's matters anything to her in this world, and she's starting to act up against her grandmother, and scratching her and bitting her and fighting her, and suddenly she doesn't wanna leave the swamp with like intense and fighting for it.

0:05:56.5 S1: And then 'cause Sally's never known what the outside world is, of course, she's scared to leave the swamp and she doesn't wanna go with the strange woman, that she's met twice in her life, and so the grandmother knocks her out, to just try and get her to stop screaming and stop bitting. Meanwhile, the grandmother is bleeding out and the toy is getting shifted all over, and Sally is just laying there unconscious on the ground of the grandmother's boat.

0:06:32.8 S2: And well, the grandmother tries to get out of the swamp and leave the burning boat behind. The parents realize that something is burning in their swamp and something just blew up. The explosion caused this huge, like a loud sound. They're trying to figure out what's going on, and they're trying to figure out how to get where this explosion happened.

0:07:00.0 S1: But unfortunately the parents only have one boat. So they see this huge fire out in the swamp, but they have no means of getting there. And the dad just starts running and just starts diving, and trying to make his way through the swamp, but it's just a dragging him down. And he's getting stuck in the mud. And he sees alligators waking up and swimming away from him in fear.

0:07:28.7 S2: And it's a good thing he's scaring away the alligators, but still, he's not making progress in trying to save his daughter. The only thing that's left for him to do is call the one other person that he knows was living in the swamp, this weird fisher guy, for help. He looks like Bruce Willis. And he's probably him retired in the swamp, but he's not really sure he is, so he calls him and he tells him.

0:08:00.2 S1: He tells him to get in his boat and go see if it's his daughters boat is the one that blew up. And so this Bruce Willis dude just gets in his boat and starts slamming out into the swamp. He has one of this ship that has the big fans in the back and it's just flying across the water. And he sees the grandmother's boat, but he's confused because it's heading in the direction of the parents' house. And so he starts chasing the grandmother.

0:08:33.3 S2: And this boat following, chase, whatever kind of thing is going on. It's gonna be over soon because Bruce Willis has the superior speedboat. And he pulls up next to the grandmother, and he's trying to stop her and trying to figure out a way to talk to her. But she's dead set on to getting to the parent house, she's not stopping for him.

0:08:57.4 S1: And she realizes that she's heading straight towards the parents house. And she's panicked because she doesn't know the swamp very well. And she realizes that she actually want to be going the opposite way, 'cause she doesn't want them to know that's she's stealing Sally. But, at this point, this Bruce Willis guy is chasing her, so she's trying to steer the boat, but she's bleeding out 'cause of the shrapnel. And then she hits a huge thud. And the guy cries out in pain.

0:09:32.1 S2: He cries out in pain and he has to figure out how to deal with the situation by himself now. So he slows down, and he gives the grandmother a way to escape. So she turns the boat around and tries to go the other direction. But she realizes she won't ever figure out how to get out of the swamp by herself. So what she's gonna do? 

0:09:58.9 S1: But the son was Sally's dad. And now Sally's dad is just floating in the swamp and the mother is screaming. And Bruce Willis is just hanging on his boat and doesn't know what to do. And the grandmother is trying to go fast out of the swamp, but it's just totally lost and stuck in this pitch-black night, where the only light is the light from the Milky Way. And she starts racing at full speed in just any unknown direction.

0:10:30.9 S2: So while Sally is on the run and the parents are there, her whole family home is kinda shattered, the grandma is trying to figure out what to do. In the end, everyone comes to the realization that all they wanted was the best for this kid. And no one ever asked the kid what she wanted, what Sally actually wanted to do with her life and if she was happy with what was going on. Because they're adults, what do they care? 

0:11:00.7 S1: And so Sally grabs her toy alligator, Poncho, and just decides that what she wants most in life is just to be with him. And to just go and live away from everybody else and not to deal with the stresses of school, or the swamp, or cooking. She just wants to have fun like any normal kid.

0:11:27.7 S2: She's overwhelmed with the situation of just dealing with three people. She's never gonna make it in a world where there are more, so she decides to just go deeper into the swamp, to parts that only she has explored, that her parents never went to, that only she knows. And she knows she's gonna make a life for herself and be self-sufficient, self-sustained. And from there, figure out how to find other kids to play with.

0:11:57.3 S1: So she goes and she sets up her own beautiful, hanging tree house above the swamp. And it might be infested a little bit with mosquitoes, but this thing is just beautiful. And it has a hanging wood, swinging bridge between two compartments. And she has an entire playhouse for her pet alligator toy. And she just built it all herself.

0:12:28.8 S2: And there's this huge hammock that she loves and she cuddles up in at night. And, in the end, this place is basically paradise. And even though she has her toy, she feels kind of lonely. And she realizes that she left her grandmother behind, and that she left her parents behind, and some people probably died during her escape. And she realized that she numbed all of the pain of that by building this paradise.

0:13:00.9 S1: And she feels guilty about it. And she thinks that she'll go back. But it's been two or three years and she's just been living alone. And she doesn't even know if her parents are alive or if her grandmother survived. And if her grandmother did survive, she has to go find that out from her parents and actually interact with them. And so one night she decides, when it's pitch black and only the Milky Way's out, that she'll head back.

0:13:31.0 S2: And when she's heading back, she is driving through the old part of the swamp that she hasn't visited in three years, she used to call home. And she gets really homesick, and she's really looking forward to find her parents. But when she gets to the place where their house used to be, there's just ruins. No one is there, the place is empty. Everything is ran down, everything is broken.

0:13:58.5 S1: And it's horribly flooded. You can just see the line on the walls from the flood. And Sally thinks to herself and realizes that, just a few months before, there had been a terrible flood from a hurricane. And that she had survived it without any second-thought because she had been living in her tree house. And had barely even noticed that anything had flooded.

0:14:27.7 S2: So her only hope to find her parents right now is to assume that they went on some kind of boat and lived on the boat, and try to sit out the storm and the flood in the boat. But there is no boat to be seen anywhere, so she just sets out and drives her boat off into the sunset on the search for her parents. And in part two she might realize or she might reconnect with Bruce Willis who's help...
