0:00:00.7 Speaker 1: Okay, so a group of students see that aliens have just landed, and they get on their bikes and they're riding out. I guess these kids are like 14, 15. They're riding out and they show up and they see where the spaceship just landed. They're really excited, but they're really nervous and they're kind of hiding behind some bushes. And suddenly a door opens.

0:00:31.2 Speaker 2: And outside the door is Michael Jackson and like, "What? So one of the student is a huge Michael Jackson fan, so he is overcome by joy, and breaks cover and starts running towards Michael Jackson. But as soon as he gets close, the figure that he once thought was Michael Jackson, suddenly shifts form and turns into...

0:01:00.1 S1: It turns into a big hamburger, which is really surprising because the kids have seen spaceships before but never like this one. This is the biggest hamburger they've ever seen and they look at Michael Jackson, and they say "What's going on with your spaceship?" And he goes, "Well, kids, it's more than a spaceship, this baby, it can take anywhere you want to go."

0:01:28.3 S2: It's my new portable Neverland Ranch and then the kids are confused. And he's like, "Yeah, I didn't really die. I just got tired of being in the press all the time, so I built this spaceship with my UFO buddies, those three guys back there and just been travelling around the galaxy. Looking to find myself and I think I have."

0:02:00.1 S1: And the kids go, "That's great, Michael. I'm really happy for you. But what are your plans for the future?" And he says, "Well, I think I'm gonna go back to making music. I'm back to Earth and I have a couple a new dance moves to show you." The kid say, "Okay. Well, why don't you show us some of your dance moves?" So Michael Jackson says, "Okay but you gotta backup."

0:02:31.0 S2: So then Michael Jackson just starts dabbing not realizing that that was a move three years ago. And all the kids just looked disappointed and said, "Michael, you've lost us." Michael turns around but turns back and goes, "Psych, that wasn't my real dance move. Even though Billy Jean and I dab but my real dance move is... "

0:02:56.0 S1: And so he does a quick headstand, a handstand and he starts doing the moonwalk on his hands. And the kids are going, "Alright that's pretty cool." And then Michael Jackson goes, "Yeah, but check this out," and he pulls out a fiddle and he starts playing The Devil Went Down to Georgia on the fiddle. And he says, "Wait till you see this."

0:03:30.8 S2: And almost on cue, the fiddle seems to have been a signal for his pet to come out of the spaceship and the pet, it looks almost like a tiny dragon. It resembles that dragon thing from power Raid Heroes. This one, the green one plays his little fiddle instrument, except less robotic and more dragon-y like. He goes, "This is my dragon named... "

0:03:57.6 S1: Right, "This is my dragon named Wilbur. So Wilbur plays his own fiddle. It's a slightly smaller fiddle." And sure enough his pet comes out of the spaceship and it's a green sort of snake-like creature and he plays the fiddle with his long tongue.

0:04:30.7 S2: And then all of a sudden, it's overcome by darkness and it turns out that the snake's head is actually the great overlord Cthulhu. Which is quite unfortunate for the kids as Cthulhu feeds off the destruction of planets, so everyone is a little worried now. Cthulhu comes moaning, groaning, his usual destructiveness. But he says, "Don't worry. Don't worry I'm only here to... "

0:05:00.0 S1: "Get some ice cream." He was actually a... He loves Ben and Jerry's. So he just says hello, introduces himself and then excuses himself and heads over to Vermont, to the Ben and Jerry's factory. And really just has two scoops of ice cream and when he's there, he's talking to the ice cream salesman and he says...

0:05:35.5 S2: He says, "Cthulhu, you look really tense." He said, "My partner is actually running a yoga retreat this weekend, by Sunapee, you should come check it out. We'll get you all loosened up, and destress from all this destruction you do, all these worlds you destroy. It'll be really good." And Cthulhu says, "It's worth a shot. I don't got anything to do until Monday, so yeah, let's do it." The kids are just like, "I have no idea what's going on."

0:06:00.8 S1: So Cthulhu shows up to the class and he's feeling a little out of place. He's never really done yoga before. But he brought a mat, he brought an open mind. And you know, he really has been feeling pretty stressed from all the planet destruction. So he starts to do a little bit of a stretch and he looks over to his partners...

0:06:31.2 S2: And what do you know his partner is Doug the Pug, his old friend from middle school. "Hey yo Doug, what's happening? I didn't know you did yoga. I didn't even know you were in Vermont. I thought you were in California." And Doug goes, "I'm just here for the summer to get back in some nature, take a break from all this Doug and the Pug and stuff." And so they catch up a bit and then he tells him he chose life and then by now, Cthulhu's feeling pretty warmed up.

0:06:58.1 S1: Right, right. So Cthulhu's feeling pretty warmed up and he's psyched to see Doug the Pug and they're catching up and he says, "Well, what have you been up to recently?" And Cthulhu says "Well, I've been destroying planets." And Doug the Pug says, "Ah, typical you." And Cthulhu says, "How about you? What have you been up to?" And Doug the Pug says, "I have a family now, I've really settled down."

0:07:30.8 S2: And that just shocked Cthulhu, he's like, "Wow Doug, I guess you've totally change of pace there." It started to remind him of all the crazy stuff Doug the Pug has done in the past with all those crazy glasses he's worn, and crazy outfits he's tried on. He goes, "That's cool, that's cool. Everyone goes through different phases in life." He goes, "Doug, if you're no longer doing the Doug the Pug thing then what are you doing now? How do you get by financially?"

0:08:00.2 S1: He says, "Well, I found someone I really care about also, it's a golden retriever and we settled down, we have some kids. For a living, he does real estate. He shows people around California. He really likes it but it could be a little stressful which is why he decided to come out to Vermont to do a little bit of yoga."

0:08:29.3 S2: And then all of a sudden, Doug the Pug gets cut off by this loud sound and then the earth cracks right down the line in between Doug the Pug and Cthulhu and splits aparts. And what do you know it's a succubus, Cthulhu's ex-girlfriend. He's like "Uh oh. Haven't seen you in a while. What brings you up to Vermont?"

0:08:57.9 S1: And she goes "Doug, I know what you've done. You cannot trick Cthulhu here into thinking that you've settled down." And she turns to the Cthulhu and she says, "This man is actually responsible for a lot of those California wildfires." And the pug looked shocked. He says, "How could you? How did you know?" And she looks at him and she says...

0:09:31.3 S2: "Because I helped you start all those fires but I can't carry this guilt with me anymore." And then Doug the Pug his eyes start darting back and forth, he starts panicking. Everyone in the class is looking at him, his gig has been up, so he pulls a knife out his pocket and he goes, "Nobody move. I'm not going down." And he slowly starts backing out of the class.

0:10:00.3 S1: And there's another crack. The earth seems to be splitting in two and his long lost cousin, Jake the Snake, comes up from the earth and he says, "Alright enough. I can't let you take the blame for me any longer." And he pulls out a knife and he holds it at Doug the Pug and he says, "Stop right there and listen."

0:10:33.8 S2: But unfortunately, Jake the Snake is a snake and the knife just falls down because he's a snake. Doug the Pug slaps Jake and says, "You fool." Picks him up and then runs and runs. But also unfortunately for Doug the Pug, he's a pug and can't get very far before Cthulhu picks him up and says, "This behavior can't go on anymore Doug. I think it's finally time you set yourself straight."

0:11:00.8 S1: And Cthulhu puts his hand to the ground, and he starts shaking in pure concentration and shaking and suddenly everything warmed up and that's when they know that things are getting pretty real and Doug the Pug says, "Look, look, Cthulhu, calm down. We can work this out." And Jake the Snake says, "Look man, y'all are tripping right now. We gotta cool off."

0:11:31.5 S2: "Here, let's take this acid. So I must cool off." So they all take the acid but unfortunately since Cthulhu was already in a upset state of mind, two hours later he's in even more upset state of mind and the demons in his inner world are now the demons in the outer world and they are slowly destroying the earth. So Jake goes, "Baa." [chuckle]

0:12:03.7 S1: And Cthulhu goes, "Jake. What are you doing? Why are you throwing up?" And Jake says, "I'm really sorry. When I get this nervous, I just throw up. It's an escape mechanism." And Cthulhu says, "This is not the time." And Doug the Pug says, "Listen, I have a plan but it's gonna take all of us to work together."

0:12:28.3 S2: And Cthulhu goes, "I'm listening." Doug goes, "Alright I know I said I would tell you he plan but just follow my lead." And then he turns around, he barks twice and back comes Michael Jackson moonwalking on his head into the room. And he goes, "We're all gonna take Michael's hamburger ship and get off this earth because Cthulhu, you've destroyed it so now we gotta run." And Cthulhu goes "Uhh."

0:12:51.5 S1: Cthulhu goes, "Guys, I'd love to get on that ship but I don't know if I'm gonna fit and this acid that we took, I can't really figure out where the door is." And Jake the Snake goes, "Uhhh." And he throws up the acid that he took so he can think clearly again and he goes...

0:13:29.5 S2: And he goes, "I can think clearly but unfortunately, I don't have a lot of thoughts in my head, so I'm just gonna sit here and stare at the wall while all of you figure it out." But Doug the Pug smacks Jake in the head and goes, "You're a lot of help." And he goes, "Cthulhu this might be the last time we ever see each other, let's finally embrace those feelings we've been repressing for so long." And he leans in to give Cthulhu one last kiss.

0:14:01.8 S1: And they kiss and they embraced and they hugged. And they go, "You have been my best friend through thick and thin. You have seen me at my worst, you have seen me at my best. You have brought out the best in me. I wish we had more time together, but if there was any way to go, it would be like this, next to you, hand in hand. It's been the best moments of my life."

0:14:30.8 S2: Cthulhu returns the gesture and then Doug the Pug, Micheal Jackson, Jake the Snake and a few Vermont hippie yoga dudes go on the hamburger ship and they sail off. And then as the planet explodes, Cthulhu goes, "Not again." And then just moseys on to find the next planet to try and reside in before the inevitably destroys it. And as for the kids, well they're on the planet, so yeah.
