0:00:00.0 Speaker 1: One day, the students were on a field trip. They had just gotten done observing little Johnny making mischief in class, and they were ready to get out of the classroom. As they walked over to the school bus, they were all in awe, a spaceship was floating right above the bus, and as it landed, a little door opened, some stairs folded down to the ground. What they saw, they couldn't believe.

0:00:26.2 Speaker 2: The spaceship was enormous, it was about the size of two or four houses on top of each other. And it was shaped like an upside-down pyramid, and there was this purple smoke coming out of the bottom of it, and they saw a figure, a tall humanoid figure at the bottom, but something was different.

0:00:56.9 S1: The humanoid figure didn't have much to say at first, it stood and stared. The purple smoke was surrounding it more and more. They wondered whether the smoke was coming from the creature or whether it was coming from the spaceship. All of a sudden, the spaceship began to transform. It was an upside-down pyramid, but out came some wings, and then some little legs, it started walking around, and then it folded itself up into a little box.

0:01:29.9 S2: The students approached the box like crazy people, with no abandon. And the box began to shake a little bit, and they didn't know what was going on but stayed there without running away. Until finally, the box spit out a map, and the map was the location of where the real aliens had teleported.

0:02:00.5 S1: They wanted to follow the map to find out where the other aliens were, but the teacher suggested that they get into the bus immediately and leave. They didn't want to, so one of the brave students approached the original alien, the being, and tried to communicate with it. The student slowly crept towards the being, more purple smoke came out, they decided that the purple smoke was coming from the alien. He said, "Hello,"

0:02:26.0 S2: He said, "Hello," because the box head transformed again, because it turns out that these aliens can actually shapeshift. And now, it had shifted into the form of a human and it looked just like them and sounded just like them and spoke like them. And they couldn't tell the difference. And they said, "What are you? How did you get here?"

0:03:00.5 S1: The alien said he was from the planet Mavenscnuk. He had traveled years and years, light years to the planet Earth to see what other life forms there were, and he was thrilled to find that he could mimic their behaviors. He somehow learned English instantly, and wondered what he should ask the students. The students all had questions at once, "How old are you? Do you have parents? Are there more?"

0:03:26.3 S2: The alien said, "My name is Tom, I'm 732 million years old, and I came into existence through budding. And so I don't have parents, I just have other mes. And on my planet, there's billions of Toms, and they can be whatever shape or from that they want.

0:03:58.2 S1: The alien went on to explain that he liked that they can all change shapes and be whatever they wanted to be. They could take turns being the goalie when they were playing soccer, they have somehow intercepted television waves, and they knew what soccer was. All the kids wanted to play soccer because they figured he could transform himself into a wall or maybe even a giant foot. They were all screaming and laughing. The teacher, again, told them to get into the bus.

0:04:29.6 S2: But Tom told them, "I'm here for one reason and it's to find more Toms. You see, for millions of years, Toms from my planet have been going to other planets. Shape-shifting, appearing the appearance of what ever they inhabited it and assimilating to their culture, so there could be a lots of Toms on this Earth, who look just like you and me. Well, me currently."

0:04:56.6 S1: It turns out the aliens have an excellent sense of smell in the way that Tom could find more Toms was to sniff them out. He morphs into a giant nose. The children started giggling and laughing, they thought that was funny. But as Tom went to smell around, he smelled and smelled, he got closer to a tree, and all of a sudden the tree turned into a human, he had found his first Tom. "Hello, Tom," he said. "Hello Tom," he replied.

0:05:29.3 S2: He immediately killed the former tree and explained to the students. He shot it with a weird zap gun and explained to the students, "Look, you all are in danger. Any of the rogue Toms who have left our Mashneka planet are rogues and they seek to harm you. They could be anywhere, your teachers even, your government officials, they're aliens.

0:05:56.4 S1: The children looked around in curiosity and realized that their teacher had disappeared. "Where did she go? Why wasn't she asking them to get into the bus?" They suddenly realized that she was a Tom, they had to find her, they had to stop her from taking over their planet. They looked in the bus, they looked under the bus and Tom began to sniff. He sniffed and sniffed and he followed her trail back to the classroom. They found her under the desk. They asked her how she could do this? Why has she not told them that she was a Tom? 

0:06:29.4 S2: The teacher had immediately, instead of answering any of their questions, shifted again into a giant spider thing but it was incredibly agile and jumped around the room a lot, scared all the students, before jumping out the window. So everybody was really shooked, and the original Tom that came out of the spaceship comes after it.

0:07:00.5 S1: The students knew what to do when she ran out the window, they said, "Quick, Tom, morph into a bird. You can morph into a bird to catch the spider that wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her." We know that song, it works. Tom morphed into a bird and chased the spider. He caught up with the teacher and grabbed it with his talons and took her off into the distance, never to be seen again.

0:07:29.9 S2: The only thing that was seen, was two people. A man and a woman came back from over the hill, where the bird had taken the spider creature. And the man and woman come back and they approach students who are actually graduate students, so they're adults, and the students don't think much of it and just carry on for months and then years.

0:08:04.0 S1: So the students decided that they needed to do a research on the Toms, several of them have switched from psychology majors to biology to try to figure out what was going on. They found some of the remains of the spider and put it into test tubes and petri dishes. The parts on the petri dishes grew into different beings, mimicking more Toms.

0:08:28.4 S2: There was one student, who became a scientist, who raised one of these specimens through adulthood in a matter of months, because they grow through adulthood really fast, and found he was having feelings for this specimen, romantic ones that he couldn't explain. Specimen was shaped as a female, a human female, as a...

0:09:00.6 S1: It was a little awkward because he had raised this being, but he decided he could separate his professional life from his home life and he proposed. He actually took the being a hike up to the top of the mountain where the spider had then left before, told about her creation and asked her to marry him.

0:09:27.8 S2: Upon hearing this, the Tom, who was going by Guinevere at the time, immediately jumped off of the cliff where they were and shifted into a bird point and ran away, or flew away. As she flew away, a single tear shed from her Tom, Guinevere, bird face, as she thought about all of the fears she had of committing to a marriage.

0:09:54.8 S1: He thought he had lost her, he sat there for quite some time deciding what to do. He didn't know if he should try to go after her, there's no way he was catching a bird, he didn't know if he should start again, could he ever have feelings for another Tom, that wasn't Guinevere or with the new Tom be the same as Guinevere? Would he be able to tell them apart? Suddenly, he saw her coming back over the horizon, he was thrilled.

0:10:27.8 S2: She decided she had nothing to lose and went ahead and married the scientist, who used to be a student. And one day, years into their marriage, they're watching the news and the government had begun a new program to identify all Toms infiltrating their society and totally penalize these aliens as foreign and came up with a systematic way to...

0:11:00.8 S1: They didn't know about sniffing out Toms, that they each had the ability to find another Tom themselves, and said they decided to form a search party, the scientists didn't know exactly what they were doing, what they were determined. The student and Guinevere decide that they would either have to hide or potentially leave the planet. They thought that they would try to stay, they liked their life here, and came up with a way to cover up her identity.

0:11:28.9 S2: But the government was relentless, they spent billions of dollars hiring teams of officials who were breaking into schools, and administrating testing in airports, it was just a witch-hunt for these aliens. But the scientist, who's name was Bill, and Guinevere, felt real love for one another.

0:11:56.7 S1: They decided to move to a different country, one that was less into science where they might be able to live in a cabin or a straw hut for a while, live off the lands. They moved there, they got some pets, no spiders though, that was a bad memory and they made friends with the locals, they started a school to educate the people there about who they are and where they came from.

0:12:29.6 S2: There was trouble in paradise. Guinevere and Bill extensively were living a good life, but there was an urge in Guinevere/Tom to be with people of her own kind, there was just something different and she wanted to find other Toms. They spoke about it.

0:12:58.2 S1: She started to cry, she felt terrible that she would do this to Bill, she did loved him, but it wasn't enough. She decided that she would go back to her planet, although she didn't know where it was, she had been created here and brought up here, and she needed to find someone else who knew. Bill decided that he would have to let her go. From his pocket, he took a crumpled piece of paper, it was the map.

0:13:24.2 S2: She had never seen it before, she vaguely recognized some of the symbols on it, but they were symbols on the map were written in her original Tom language, which she wasn't as fluent in anymore, she's been speaking English for a while. But something inside her recognized the symbols as a way to get home. So she began to follow that map.

0:13:58.3 S1: It was a challenge because she didn't speak Tommies fluently, she decided that she would just do the best she could and hopefully she would find someone along the way, another Tom, or many multiple Toms to ask what to do. She morphed into a spaceship, first a cube, and then folded up her legs into a triangle. It was an upside-down pyramid and it blasted off. Bill watched from afar with a single tear sliding down his face.

0:14:27.6 S2: And then decided, "I can't have Guinevere, no one will." He thinks quickly about what to do as the ship is looking now beginning to fly off and grabs this giant experimental bazooka from his old lab. He's frantic now and just filled with rage and sadness.
